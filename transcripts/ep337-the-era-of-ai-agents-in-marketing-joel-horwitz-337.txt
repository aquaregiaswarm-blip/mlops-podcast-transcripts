There's a big like product LED growth. Everyone wants to be like data dog. Everyone wants to be like sneak or everyone wants to be like Docker and like, oh yeah, we don't need sales people. Like, we're just gonna put our product out there, it's gonna be great, it's gonna sell itself, you know, we're just gonna put all of our money and resources in a product development, and we'll never have to deal with sales and marketing people ever again. Thank goodness. No, it's just not, it's just not real people buy from people. I really believe that.
 Sure, it's founder of neoteric 3D which stands for digital design and data.
 I like my coffee black. I like usually, I just like a double espresso, where I go.
 Just like me short and sweet and sometimes a little bitter. And yeah, that's me in a nutshell and funny enough, I reference marketing use cases all the time for AI. And I've got another buddy that I always say is. Yeah, my friend and marketing is doing this and he's got quite a complex.
 Agentic workflow set up. You are not that friend but you are also doing a genetic workflows. Yes.
 Far beyond.
 Having asking Chachi BT to write you a blog post, right?
 yeah, that was basically the you know I think of like Jasper and even before the chat GPT like that was the big thing was like,
 Still is I would argue and most people don't want to talk about it because they're like they don't want to admit that they're probably still doing it right creating content with AI.
 and you know, because they're like oh at hallucinates and it's not very good and
 But from what I've seen, it's gotten a heck of a lot better, you know? And so now people just stop talking about it because they're like, well, there's an Arbitrage opportunity where if I don't talk about it, I can keep charging what I've been charging, you know, for creating content.
 And no one. Hopefully no one's the wiser but what's even more exciting. Now that also people aren't talking about maybe they do a little bit. I see a few I just saw blog post today by Adam showing field.
 Who was talking about, yeah. Like, you know, the
 You know, the original kind of like AI Solutions and automations were more. Like they do say personalization and it was all about quantity like, oh, well, you can, you can generate, you know, thousands if not tens of thousands of cold emails and cold Outreach. And you know, even if you get one percent, it's still you know you know some some good leads that can come in and everyone just got spammed. And so that's kind of like
 what the, you know, what, what people, you know, view as the
 As the status quo. Yeah, it's it's nice. He actually had a really nice graph. I'll try to pull it up later if I can, but basically, he shows actually
 And what I'm seeing is now it's more value creation, it's more like quality, like you can create much better in my view like much better.
 You know, interactions not just emails interactions. And I use that word because it's like it's not just content as we talk, you know, just as you mentioned,
 It's across the board and now that's always been the marketing. You know, play is like how do you meet meet your target audience, where they are with the right content? Or the right message, right? That that's timely and effective. And so nowadays, I think there's, I mean, within the last few weeks I feel like it's like, always getting better. Um, I would I would argue I think my hypothesis is that the types of experiences you can create for people
 As a marketer now far, outweigh what you could do manually, so to speak, right?
 Um, you know, it's like analog digital, right? It's like sure like you could still, you know, do things in a log. But um, but but I think there's a, there's a Tipping Point not to sound too Market or but there is a, there is a inflection point happening where
 like the what you can do in terms of like using identic AI
 Far, surpasses. Anything else that I've ever seen? It's amazing. It really is. All right. Well the obvious. Next question is give me some concrete ways that you're doing this.
 So some concrete ways. I think that people are are leveraging this and, to be honest it's
 I know we talked about agentic AI but this is also Harkens back to the big data error as well, right? Circuit 2010s, which I certainly live through. And there's a lot of similarities, a lot of the types of workbooks or workflows that I was building back then using, you know, Hadoop and products like data mirror, right? It's synonymous in essence. It's like Clay is essentially dating, you're like three dot. If you ask me, it really is because it's still uses that same workbook, you know, kind of format which everyone's familiar with. So the concrete example is we're using clay at a number of our clients to essentially
 create the type of workflow aware when we recognize an intense signal, whether that comes from like someone who just started a free trial or someone who just within a within an account posted, a new job opportunity. We can basically get a sense of of that person and that account.
 And then use agentic AI to not only craft an Outreach kind of sequence if you will not just through email and phone calls. But like, we can create like really cool memes like with that person's actual image.
 Right? We can create use like I just I recorded a Founder's voice the other day so like I can use his voice. Now to basically have like a personalized message from that founder to a prospect.
 which I know I mean people are gonna see this and here's like oh that's so you know, sleazy that you do that, but
 now, I mean
 it's it's it works and it's it's quite effective, you know? And so there's yeah, my question is, why is that or how is that agentic? Mmm.
 Yeah, I think the agentic part is where you're using, you know, what you would call like AI, researchers or AI agents to go out and look for these signals, right? Um and it's quite impressive. Like there's there's a whole
 There's a whole industry of products out there that, you know, charge a lot to get this type of information. But if you have an agent that you've developed, that actually can go out there and essentially do the type of operational research that like an SDR would do like a sales development rep would do. So, for example, you know, um, you can basically write an agent to go and basically check their LinkedIn profile as you would as anyone would like, basically mirror. Like, I literally, like one of the first things I do, when I, I onboard a new client is, I basically sit like, shoulder to shoulder to them and, and basically, um, and map their kind of their work day, right? Like, what do you do when you get up in the morning? And they're like, well, I go obviously check my emails but then I go and
 go and Linkedin. I'm looking at who came in like, sign up for a trial or form or contact us whatever. So, I want to take you through the whole Shield but, you know, I sit down and go okay, what are, what is this person doing? And then I turn around, I work with our development team. And I say, okay, how do we recreate that within AI agent to do exactly the same thing so that we can scale them from an individual to, you know, a number of of agents that can do that for them. I mean, that's basically what it is.
 yeah, and now I guess where I'm
 trying to see is like,
 You have someone that shows the strong signals and I really like that where oh, there's a job posting or there's sign up for a free trial and potentially what the best action is is having an SDR. Get them on the phone, right, right? Okay. But that's easier said than done, right? And so you want to entice them in other ways and you don't want to have that SDR half to
 Spend 10 or 15 minutes creating a meme that may or may not get read. And so how can you create these workflows that are leveraging, your creativity?
 Of going out there and getting prospects to answer. But
 That also are not.
 Having the workforce have that like time, intense activity. I mean I think that's what's exciting about this at least as far as I can tell is that it's I think there's a lot of like people who might make the argument. Well if you can do this with AI agents and you don't really need, you know, a sales development rep or what have you, but that's not what I'm finding at all, because it's not like these things are, you know, copy and paste. You know, every SDR has their own kind of flavor of how they, you know, style really of how they do things. Sorry for the background noise. I'm on campus, but
 They have their own, you know, style of doing these things and so that's really what you're, what you're doing. And so um, yeah like one.
 When you, when you basically look at a account, I definitely do think at the account level, right? Because you know beyond say, like startups where the founder is, like, the person that's purchasing, you know, piece of software, right? When you get in the larger companies, say over 100 million in ARR.
 Um, it's usually multiple people who make a buying decision, right? You have to go through multiple kind of buyer, you know, decision making and so I think it really is at the account level and the reality is they're just isn't enough time in the day for them to truly understand, like what's in, what's in that account, you know, going through and reading their, you know, if they're a public company. You know. They're they're filings, right? Or if they're private company going and searching things like crunchbase or, you know, pitch book to see kind of like other information like understanding their competitor, like, there's a ton of research right that goes into it that I think a lot of the agentic AI stuff solves where, which is really exciting. But like you said, there's also the creative part of creating not just like a meme, but also, we created entire websites for them. Right? So, you know, today like you said, like, yeah, you're depending on
 You know what the relationship is with that Prospect?
 You know, getting them to it, you know, getting them on a call or asking them for meeting is probably way you know premature right? Realistically what you're doing is you're trying to surface.
 In trying to educate them to understand how your product or service.
 Meets their specific needs because the biggest mistake that I see people make in marketing at least is, you know, assuming that there's there it's like a blank slate. Like there's nothing there already. And oftentimes there's a lot there already like people have built their entire you know, development environments or entire data, you know, environments. And so you have to find a way how you can reasonably, you know, enter, you know, integrate yourself into that. And so, you know, we build
 Some incredible personalized websites we've used Mutiny as a vendor for that. I did there's a whole blog that was written about how we did that at a client called single store which was exciting.
 We're we're doing that also creating customized like LinkedIn ads for specific accounts. A specific messaging based on what we find and it works. I mean, I've, it's been, it's been crazy because I've actually seen Target accounts like thumbs up and like LinkedIn ads. I've never seen that before. My, my time where like the account itself is like giving us a thumbs up for the ad because it's so
 You know, on on topic, right? It's so on target with like the messaging. So anyways, it's it's exciting. It's an exciting time to be a marketer. I would say.
 So, let's run through a few more of these use cases. I think they're fascinating. I've seen folks on the marketing side who are buying
 Google AdWords, they will use
 Llms to update the AdWords because every once in a while, you get certain keywords, that go stale or have to, you have to continuously be checking your AdWords account, and making tweaks and whatnot. And so they'll use llms to help them optimize the spend there and just update these stale keywords. Yeah.
 I've also seen it for keywords with SEO and use it or tool like a refs or just a keyword. Yes, exactly. Samora getting
 the CSV maybe for
 Certain keywords that you're trying to rank for and then the llm can tell you what other keywords you might want to be ranking for, and which ones you should really try to optimize for? Because they seem like they have the best score. Yeah.
 Yeah and then there's also negative keywords, right? I mean you know I I generally how I've seen this work in the anal I think the analog to digital is a really good kind of construct the way to think about this that you know, prell and you know post llm like prell or analog version of this is downloading. You know, the CSV file of all of your keywords for the last 30 days or 90 days, whatever the window is going through. And basically you know marking the ones the keywords that are you know that are leading to a conversion and the ones that are not leading you that are not. And so those are what are called like negative keywords, right? And so you literally mean we go through and like check make those checks and then re-upload, you know, those keywords into your campaign and that's kind of how you do it. There's all other ways like you can let like Google decide for you like just say, actually I'm gonna have Google optimize, you know, my, my keyword list, but
 I don't know. But yeah, I think that's a, that's a really cool. Use case, I expect to see that a lot more. I think what I'm hearing actually even interestingly enough, like Google AdWords itself. I feel like is, you know, I've been I don't know if you ever listen that all in podcasts but there's a lot of conversation about what that what search looks like in the age of, of llms and chat GPT. And so now we can actually I can see like the, you know, UTM parameters coming in for a lot of my clients because I'm like I'm definitely like a pretty firm believer that you have to UTM every link ever. So you know what's going on and so I can view a lot of the utms and I've been noticing more and more like the referral being open Ai and like some of these. So I think the bigger conversation is how do you SEO for llms like for open, you know, for chat GP or gemini or what have you what I'm hearing from you know, people like
 That are SEO experts. I'm not an EXO, SEO expert, but people who are have told me that in general, it's following kind of the similar patterns, like, of Getting indexed By search and that sort of thing. Um, but there's still a bit, a little bit of an unknown, about how these LMS are indexing, write blogs and pages in that. But I definitely see like growth in terms of referral traffic coming from chat. Gbt, it's kind of wild to watch that kind of like go up compared to like just Google search.
 Yeah, I've heard it called, answer engine optimization. So it's like a e o and SEO.
 Yeah. Yeah, I'd be curious like, um, you know, maybe as a follow-on, if you had someone, you know, that knows those things better. I know you have an extensive network of people who maybe can see behind the scenes with some of these things, I'd be very curious as a marketer to know, to know that because definitely I mean shoot, I go, I go to chat GPT now more than for sure than Google search like to get answers for sure. So, yeah. I think that's a, that's a big kind of tectonic shift that's happening in marketing right now.
 Well, and the whole conversation is around.
 Okay, are click through rate or basically, our page views.
 Are lowered. We're getting less traffic sent to us from search.
 but we're still getting more relevant traffic and so even though it's less, we're getting relevant traffic because it is again that it
 Answer that will link back to you from Chad GT or Gemini output and it's like you're eight steps out of 10.
 On your journey. Yeah. And you don't need to sift through all this like super top of the funnel crap that wasn't getting you any actual paying customers. It was just getting your SEO agency, a whole lot of cooling. Yeah. You've tapped in to something that is it? That's just the, that's just the so called tip of the iceberg. I mean, there there were so many I would say, Circa like 2020 2021 like the last five years. I feel like that, that whole game of top of funnel, you know, marketing is just got blown out, blown out, completely. Like I would be very surprised if there's a single CEO or CMO that even like,
 You know, we used to call it vanity metrics and somehow it got like lost in the shuffle that it's still vanity metrics. And, you know, and and what would happen is Is Not only would you get
 I hate to say junk traffic, but you would I mean, even get Bots and things, right. That would come in and people would Pat themselves on the back, but even more. So they then say well. But at least they like signed up and then you go and look at those sign-ups and they're like, all Gmail Yahoo qq.com like, you know, and again, I hate to say garbage signs but they were. And so one of the things that's actually been kind of a breakthrough, with a lot of my clients is in fact using these AI agents to do research on those emails, to actually figure out who these people are. And a lot of people
 Don't realize like you can actually I mean you have to be really careful with pii and all of that but you can figure out who they are now and you can say oh this is actually competitor that's in there trying to like get information. And so we we didn't know that like with a few of our clients and you can kind of put them on a different path so to speak. So how are you doing that? Just by creating workflows that are researching the Gmail address it and
 Yeah. Yeah. So you can basically use their. I mean, they give you a couple pieces of information. It's I think there's a guy who does a lot of the training for clay, same as Yaz. And he says, like one of the back in my college days, I used to work for UPS to pay my way through school and when your stack I used to load these containers like full of boxes and they say, there's like a Cornerstone box and like the program was actually called Cornerstone. And so yes, to take a box and you start in one corner of the of the trailer, right? Then you'd build your wall from there, so the boxes don't fall on you when you're, when you're loading and that's kind of what this is. Like you have a Cornerstone piece which is basically, you know for now anyways is your LinkedIn profile.
 and so, basically,
 You can you can try to search using these AI agents, their Gmail and then you can see also based on their, you know, first and lastly, if they give that to you, um, and there's ways, you know, to figure out who they could be and it's not 100%. I think we get about a, I'd say the industry average right now is about 40, 45 percent hit rate. So you still don't, there's still a bunch of you don't know, but the bottom line is, like, we're implementing this idea. Like, I don't know, you know, most people have like
 you know, mqls sqls, they have lead scoring like that whole
 Like domain is completely getting upended by this AI kind of evolution, right. And I call it Evolution not a revolution because it is, it's evolving.
 What why is it no more nqos?
 Well, because it's such a wrote, you know, analog model, right? It's like well they they clicked on four links or they visited your website and they also attended a webinar and they downloaded the white paper. But
 You know, that's not really like they're ready to purchase. They could just have a lot of free time on their hands, I don't know, right, you know what I mean? Like, and that's probably true. And then the alternative is then you get like a SQL which is a sales qualified lead, right? And they're gonna say, well, this is a really good lead because I know a guy who knows a guy and and we think that they're really, you know, a perfect Target for our solution and um, and so on and so forth, you know, but really what you want is an AI ql which kind of removes, a lot of that subjectivity, I think. I mean, there's a new type of subject too coming from AI. But you know, what it can do is, like I said, you have to feed it a bunch of signal, right? Like I said, so job posting, public filing, you know? Or like there's the org chart, right? So there's a, there's a website called the org, you know.com. So there's ways to figure out like who's who in the zoo like that's a buddy of mine used to say that I'd be him all the time which
 Kind of got annoying after a while, but anyways, but it's true, like, who's who in the zoo and who has the budget and what are they? What's that, what are they really need to pay? And do they have a competitor all ready? And what's the relationships like? Because yeah. Like, and I'm sure, you know, like it's it's a very complex
 Thing to sell, you know, sell enterprise software into a large organization.
 Well, one thing that I
 Am trying to wrap my head around, is you get all these signals? You get all this data.
 and,
 Some of it may be incomplete.
 And then, where are you throwing? All of this? Just into a context window and then asking an llm to say, are they in the buying cycle or not? And then they get a score that gets fed to the sales team or how does that process look of. Hey, we got all these signals. This person looks like a green light we should reach out. Yeah, we automatically reach out with AI and we get something back and it only gets surfaced when they respond because we've done all these cool memes and this audio generation from the founder, like full picture in in, for me. Well, we have so, one of the other things that we developed is a unified kind of inbox, right? And so, um, so we feed all of the kind of the Outreach, if you will into kind of a single inbox and anyone can view in the company. And so, you know, when someone replies back like to one of these
 Um, you know, tactics we can immediately have someone jump in and say, hey, yeah, I saw, you know, that you are interested in in such and such or so and so and we can immediately start that conversation. Um, but yeah, they hit a certain threshold where
 you know, they they put out a job posting that mentions, you know,
 For example, like, for one of our clients, they're targeting like my SQL shops because my SQL is known to basically, you know, basically, tap out after a certain level of concurrent users, right? For an application. So we're always looking to say, okay, they're trying to do some implementation of my sequel for some sort of sass application. So when we see that kind of job posting and it kind of mentions, some of these things. Um, then I actually take, like you said, it's within that within that context window and then we actually integrated into slack. And so, we have our own little bot if you will, within art. Because that's where people live nowadays and slack is, I'm sure, you know,
 and so we have a slack that actually pings the rep and says, hey, like as a person would, as an SDR would it says, hey, I noticed you know, your
 A cover, you know your your coverage this area or you're the AE the account executive for this account, right? You should know that. They just put out this job posting. And here's the hiring manager, you should here's their LinkedIn contact. And by the way, here's some interesting facts, you should know about them. They happen to be a marathon or they like to paint in their free time or they have kids, or what have you, and then you can actually they they themselves. Can also write a really nice note um, which increases their odds of of acceptance?
 And so you're getting that ping. Do you have the capability? Because I can see this being like, the marketers cursor. You know where? Yeah. It's a really good analogy. Yeah, you, and you can go back to the bot and say draft me up.
 A LinkedIn message that is relevant. Like you know what we're doing, and the job post has XML of crossover. Yeah, I think that's a great analogy. I don't think I think Clay is probably the closest thing I see, but it's still pretty
 Like WorkFlowy, you know what I mean? Like their soul a lot of I don't think we've really now someone has at y combinator or somewhere somewhere else wants to talk to me and we want to start at start something because I don't think there is a cursor for marketing yet. I do think there should be. I do think there should be a
 You know, a way to like, you know, like you can't with replicate or cursor, right? Just go in there and say, I want to launch a campaign to, you know, cybersecurity companies and it'll automatically create, you know, the entire, you know, campaign that includes, you know, ad copy and creative, the messaging, you know, a target audience, the landing pages, the white papers, the content based on all that. Like I'm not aware of anything that exists today. I have to base. I mean, that's why I have an agency, right? Is because it doesn't exist and I have to do that essentially manually but Stitch all these things together. So there's a lot of
 Bespoke solutions that that touch like what we've all what we've been talking about. But
 I feel like I'm more of like a system integrator for marketing today, right? Is this really what the job is today as a marketer? It's your assistant integrator period? That's how I see it. Yeah, it's funny that you mention that because I was just talking to a friend Sean last week on how if you look at any job.
 What?
 people are doing in their job is just
 Getting they want the end result. You want the job to be done type of thinking, where you don't buy a drill?
 To drill things, you buy a drill because you want to put a picture up on the wall. And so you need to drill a hole in the wall and then then you can hang that photo. So you want that end result, right? But there's all these steps in between, there's these tasks in between and maybe some of it is moving data from over here and putting it over here. You're right. Or it is creating something over here. And so all these tasks that you can break out in that whole end-to-end flow.
 Is.
 Where you are starting to see now?
 AI play a part in some of these tasks whether or not it is helping with the productivity of your able to spend something up faster or it's just it can go ahead and do it for you and then you can give it the sign off or sometimes, people don't even give it sign off. They just throw out shit. Yeah I think that's a really really important point. I think there's two points in there that you made that are really important. One is you absolutely need to still sign this stuff off because it's still not 100%. I think I had a I had a salesperson and share with me the other day that we totally got the name, wrong of this person, for whatever reason. And I was like you guys, that's not my name, that's not what I do.
 Crap. And it happens, right? I mean, there's still some margin of error with these things and, and so it happens but, you know, you you basically own it, and you say, you're right, you know, this was, we got to ahead of our cells and you know, but I think even humans make mistake, I always think about, like the argument against like self-driving cars. It's like, oh, you know, they there's one accident this year, so we should just cancel the whole program. Like, wait a second, like, how are humans doing out there with with the car driving and the, in the market situation? Like, I don't think it's 100% either last, I checked, right? So we have this weird, like, I thinking, that, you know, we should hold AI to this higher standard that we do humans for some reason. And I think that's a little bit misplaced. I'm like, I get it, like we should do better, but on the other hand, we should really be. Well, the second comment that you made about buying the drill. Again, I think it's it. You're absolutely right. And and, you know, using that kind of analogy.
 What's the biggest thing? At least for me when I'm hating hanging a painting like missing the stud, right? So, again, you have to find a signal because I can, I can build amazing campaigns but if I if I miss that or if I missed the target, all of that's for not, right? And so that's why these AI agents are so critical right for marketers is and because you can spend, I've seen literally like people spend millions and tens of millions of dollars on campaigns.
 Because they had the wrong messaging, or they had the wrong audience or they had the wrong offering.
 And you know all of that could have been avoided. Had there been a bit more research done at the start?
 So really deeply, understand the pain of what that Prospect is going through. And that's what I think, you know, a lot of marketers just don't have the time to do because they're so focused on like,
 Doing the Tactical stuff, right? So I'm actually, like, think there's like a Renaissance coming of marketing because we're not going to be, you know, charged with having to spend 90% of our time. Just like finally things and and building, we can actually spend more of our time. Like really understanding that customer, which is, I think what marketing is supposed to be doing at the outset. But anyways,
 It's just funny that you mention. Hey, I'm a systems integrator because it
 Goes back to.
 What my friend Sean was saying is that we're all going to become Architects. Yeah. And we are
 Going to be as good as we are, able to architect our system. And so if we can put all these disparate pieces of
 AI capabilities to gather and make a cohesive system out of it. Then we're going to get so much more lift from that. Yeah, yeah. 100%. And I think what, like I said, I think we're really at the early at the early days of this. But who am I to say? Like I just, I just have my little purview. I'm sure there are people that are doing amazing, things that they don't talk about, you know, because it's probably their IP. Um, but yeah, I, I would say that it's, it's really quite fun. I mean, that's the other part about this. Like, I remember like marketing used to be really fun. Like, in the 2000s, I guess like in the age of the internet and all of that, and then like we ran like some amazing campaigns and people have really fun with it. And then like, it got, it stopped being fun. Like, I think developers like lash back against marketers like it was like, you know, with pitchforks. Like you know, and going after I was in a I was at a conference not too long ago and I was sitting in a room.
 Now, I'm trying to remember which one it was, but it was a while back and oh, I think it was a, it was a kubernetes con conference in Chicago. That's where it was. And so, these are pretty hardcore developers. And so I was sitting on
 In this like, investor room.
 And I mean if you're just like I didn't, I almost like wanted to like sneak out of there cuz I'm like they're just like, just bashing marketing. Like oh, like marketing always gets developers wrong and don't hire them and they're terrible like, oh no, I gotta get out of here but I still think that's, there's a little bit of that and I get it. Like, I think there's been, you know, times look I live through the IBM, Watson era, quite honestly, right? So I was, I can tell you like, there's there was a bit of hand waving at that time, quite honestly, right? Which has been, I think is fairly well, on understood at this point. And, and so, yeah, I get it, like, you know, marketers are trying to push the envelope, and get people excited about a new technology, or a new service or new product. And they sometimes go too far. And that's something you have to really, really cautious of
 But going back to this point, I just wanted to close the loop on the cursor for marketers.
 Or the Devon or whatever, insert your favorite code agent.
 For marketers. I think that is
 something that
 would be incredible because if you can prompt
 The whole campaign. Yeah, I mean there's they're already is um ways to do that. Like for example, there is an integration right now between clay and webflow. I don't think it's a great integration yet. As far as I know, we personally like at single store, we use Mutiny. So we were actually building these pages on Mutiny that could basically customize. Yeah, like, based on, on what we knew about about the account, right? And so, we can speak to speak to their pain points and use like, we literally update the like, the customer case studies, right? Based on the customer that came in, right? You'd want to find a lookalike right to the customer that you're targeting saying, you know, did you know, your competitor is using us to do this, right? And they go, okay, like there's always like a fomo there. Um, but yeah, I, I saw some more recently. Someone said that.
 Vibe marketing is a thing already. I mean I feel like it's happening. I'm just not like, I'm in like so heads down, that's sometimes you forget to kind of look up and look around like, okay, what, what other people doing? Because I'm like so in the weeds of building these things like, you know, going to build her mode.
 And then you pause. Oh no. Someone just like
 Fixed this over there.
 So like, I gotta go like, jump on that train now. So yeah, it's it's happening man. I think this it's good that we're having this conversation because I it's it's often interesting to me how I do meet Founders. How I do me very Savvy CEOs at you know, growth companies as well who aren't really recognizing the the opportunity that exists like right now, like the second right? There's still investing like in a lot of these more traditional like marketing tactics like quite honestly, and no offense to any friends of mine out there, but like, like going to these giant trade shows quite honestly. It's like I get it like there's a, there's a level of, you know, it's, it's cool that you can like connect with people in real life. I think that's fine. But boy, it's it's it's it's very resource. Intensive versus like coming in with like more of like a scalpel and like kind of figuring out how to find, you know, how to
 To generate that conversation differently. So, yeah, I think I think there's definitely going to be um, you know.
 There's definitely going to be a group of people who.
 Don't transition fast enough to AI agent marketing, quite honestly, or Vibe, marketing, if you want to call it, that versus those who kind of stick with the, with the traditional, you know, approach and I can already see it. I can see in a couple of places, but I'm convinced that those who jump on the AI stuff sooner than later, will likely.
 Likely jump out ahead within the next, you know, a few months. I think it's a real thing.
 one thing that's fascinating, and I'm trying to
 grapple with, in my mind is how we have this whole
 systems and very much like marketing UPS type thing where
 you are tactical and you're
 Creating.
 Very specific.
 And like you said, almost like these sniper type of bullets that are going out. But then you also have the thought leadership in the brand building. And the stuff that I think
 It goes a really long way especially because as you said 90% of folks that are finding out about you or trying, you probably aren't in the buying cycle. Yeah. So you want to figure out how you can keep that conversation going with them until they are in the buying cycle and you can become that trusted advisor. And that's where I feel like
 you cannot use AI in that type of
 Thought leadership per se or at least maybe in the way that I'm thinking about it, which would be a podcast for example or going. Yeah. To
 Maybe it's giving talks on stages is all so a little bit harder to use Ai and not regard.
 AI can help you write the talk and I can help you distribute the podcast or create clips from the podcast. But it's not necessarily like you can use notebook LM. And now you have thought leadership because of your notebook. LM pod. Yeah. Right. Right. This is what I would say to that. So 100%, um, I would say 100% that the key to using, you know, AI agents in your, in your workflow and in marketing and frankly in business
 Is and this is why, you know, it's it's um, it's assistive versus replacement, right? And and it's because
 You still need that authenticity, right? There's no replacing it. Like people respond to other people like people. You know, our human beings are not human doing things, right? So they're looking for connection, they're looking for, you know, building relationships, they want to build trust. And so what I see is that, you know, Ai and in these agents are just really helping you to distill information. So, for example, I'm working with a startup here at Oregon State University where we're filming from today and they have a really cool computer vision technology that allows you to.
 You know, measure Monitor, and, and manage aquaculture. So, if you're if you're unaware fish, farming or seafood, farming is more than half of all of the world's food food supply, which is absurd. Like, it's crazy to think about, right? And already 85% of the wild food Seafood out. There is already, basically is no longer available, right? So only like 15% of the world's, you know, can go with wild fish.
 Um, but they were, you know, we were trying to figure out they were trying to figure out like, doing all these like, customer interviews like what to build and how to focus their go to market. So on the research side again, and so we conducted, and this is where, you know, the AI Park came in a, we were able to use, you know, AI just to go out and find these types of operations, right? Where they have large enough operations that they could use technology to count, fish or count sea, urchins or count, you know, whatever. And so we were able to get in, you know, get conversations these CEOs or these, you know, these
 A kind of seafood Farmers all over the world. Like that's amazing, right? And and so we interviewed them using Microsoft teams. And so we got the transcripts right? And we fed those into our into our AI system and they brought back like here are the concepts that you should focus on. And so, to your point, like, I don't know, you know, Demetrios like when you come up with, you know, who your guests are going to be or other topics, you should be talking about, you know, I don't know how you, you know, decide that maybe you're just, you're probably a genius is probably a big part of it, but all so it's like, but how do you like take all those conversations you have? And that's sized them. Like, now we have gone and now, we have all these other things that can, like, do that for you, but you still need to marry that with other, you know, information, right about, you know, these macro moves and these other things that are going on, right? And I think that's the part where, you know, these AI agents can help you craft a better, you know, message.
 And think about what you actually should be talking about as a thought leader.
 To your to your point. All right, so you're always kind of staying on The Cutting Edge.
 That's cool.
 but again, it doesn't
 abstract away the actual time in conversations with folks,
 it is more the originality or the ability to come up with new ideas. You have a sparring partner now that you can call up or
 Spar with at any moment of the day. Yeah yeah I mean it's it's a great, you know.
 What's the famous line? Like Steve Jobs says that, you know, computers are basically a bicycle for your mind, right? Yeah, I mean, this is really this gets to that, right? I think more so than anything. Like it's, you know, working with these AI agents and and obviously, chat, gbt being, you know,
 Another example that it's it really is like, it's a, it's an exercise for your mind like you get much deeper insights. I hate that were but you do you get much deeper insights
 Ah, from working with this stuff than you would, then you would normally. So yeah. I I think that's you're totally right. I don't think it's a replacement though. I've come to realize that like, I get pretty excited with tech. Like, oh, yeah, we can just like, ramp this up and we can do all Ai sdrs and never have to, you know, pay a commission again. We don't need sales people. No, that's not, that's not true at all. Like there's a big like product LED growth. Everyone wants to be like data dog. Everyone wants to be like sneak or everyone wants to be like Docker and like, oh yeah, we don't need sales people. Like, we're just gonna put our product out there, it's gonna be great, it's gonna sell itself, you know, we're just gonna put all of our money and resources in a product development, and we'll never have to deal with sales and marketing people ever again. Thank goodness. No. It's just not, it's just not real people buy from people. I really believe that, you know, and whether they're buying, you know, whether you talk to them or not, they're still, you know, looking up the companies brand and they're still thinking about, you know, who is behind the product, right? And so again, like like you said, like if you're not
 out there, you know how, you know,
 basically nurturing or creating your own personal brand as a Founder, right?
 Then yeah, you're I think you're likely missing of seeing that type of growth is going to be stimulated. I don't think it's going to be the same.
 one thing that I wanted to bring up, was that, when you
 think about and you hear this Trope, it's almost cliche these days on like, oh now we're not gonna need humans to do that and it's very clear to all of us that
 you still need humans to do stuff, but what is happening that I have been seeing in a few friends reference to me, was that
 you're now looking at
 when maybe there was traditionally a python developer. Yeah, that were
 Create some kind of a mock-up in streamlit. Yeah, all of a sudden because of cursor, they can have three different types of MVPs that are built with. Yeah.
 You know, it's like you're not now magically freed up with your time. I think things just accelerate man. I think they just accelerate. So for example with this um with a startup they're called sea stereo but with this startup I was like they they have a team of of developers and engineers and, you know, he they people spend, they're spending, you know, a good portion of their time on like I would argue, like mundane stuff, you know. And so I think like, what you're describing to me is
 A lot of the remedial work and I, you know, I don't mean to be sound like, derogatory or anything when I say that. I just mean a lot of the grunt work of, like, standing up a website and creating, like a UI ux for, like a dashboard like those sorts of things. Yeah. Like I don't think a lot of people necessarily want to work on those things. And so for example, I was, um, we drove out to
 One of these, uh, you know, kind of design Partners basically like an early customer of our company. I just want to wrap it and I'm like, all right, describe to me like what you'd want to see as your dashboard and I kid you not like I, I'll send you the link, like it basically created an unbelief and I said, I wanted to look like that. I don't know if you've ever heard of that company called FrontPoint, but it's basically like a do-it-yourself security software company where you go around. You like, put in all the different sensors. And anyways, it has cameras and things, whatever. And so like I said, yeah, look at this UI and make a version of of this for like aquaculture, dude, it's fun it up and like less than an hour. It was unbelievable. And the guys, like, oh yeah, I like this. I don't like this. So we just tweak it and then they gives, you know, the engineers actually something to build too. Right. So yeah, I think I think with marketing like its it is it's like Vibe coding and Vibe and marketing, it's, it's lowering the threshold for experimentation which is something that I've always loved. I loved
 Experimenting. And I think that's if we can experiment more, we tend to be able to find ground truth that much sooner, you know, um, and that's what it's all about. So I think a lot of these, you know, break throughs
 Are really allowing us like I said to spend more time.
 Thinking much more deeply than we ever have about these user experiences or these interactions or our messages, or even the products that we're building, right? And that's I think what that's what excites me probably the most, you know.
