Amazing dude thank you for the opportunity because of course, bro. Great, hot Mart. It's a playground for data scientists because all the challenges opportunities that we've seen data science machine learning, we are tackled, we're attacking in a hot Mart for such specific problem. We still use some classical machine learning models.
 Just leave some contacts for the artists that might not know how much, but basically hotmart is the Leaning company. The Creator economy.
 So, we offer in a platform and a whole ecosystem for digital creators. Surely from the passion. So imagine online course is a ticket to books.
 Basically anything that can be distributed online, you can use hot for that. A ticket for digital events. I think like that too.
 And I like to, to say that,
 Hot Mart is a playground for data scientists, because all the challenges opportunities that we see in data science machine learning, we are tackled we're attacking in a hot Mart. So we have basically if you thinking the education industry we are trying to solve problems like spend detection.
 A fraud detection. Like, when we talk about fraud detection, we think more always about like Financial, right? People trying to make fraudulent purchases like that, but there is a lot of
 People that are created like courses.
 Trying to teach things that are not appropriated. Like, one of the good example is
 People that create courses on how you can buy fire guns, Brazil, that's something that's not allow it or how can it drugs at home? So this kind of things I read all the time. Hotmail you need to create intelligence systems to detect this beforehand and block them. So for that we use a lot of machine learning models in AI as well but just this is just the tip of the iceberg. So we created recommendations systems, we use forecast models and we've been doing that for a long time and I think I would say that our first machine learning model that went to production was like
 1,015. So something like that. And with the help of the generation, I saw a lot of opportunities as well. You just told me that you have replaced a lot. If not 90% of your tasks with LMS, but you're still using spacy for some
 Yeah. Yeah, definitely.
 I think Ellen was here first day, everybody is using its the cookie, there's not the black, but
 It's still we still use machine learning model class can help you for some tasks that even with llms.
 Even they are so powerful are so smart. But some for some specific tasks, to use our own models training with open source and like Spacey all the Frameworks like they good old if you like that. So, yeah, I think that that's a good thing to have started to work with machine learning mods before the Boon of Jane AI. Because you can see where is the opportunity to use llms and where it's to need to use things like classical and approaches. But why are you what is it? That the LMS can't do that a space in model can do actually
 If you think it like competition engineering trying to tune the model few short examples and things like that you can use llms for that, but sometimes we need a very fast solution for a specific problem. I think the the thing that comes to my mind is HTC extraction because we trained in a model for institute extraction that we still use along with other lamps, but it's way faster and cheaper for us. Imagine, and I'm talking here but I'm not saying they use case. But at hotmart, we have aias and for customers to solve a client customers tickets, like I have a problem with my account, I can pay its things like that lost my my password, if you like that.
 And can we imagine like 1000 and thousands of these tickets arriving each day and we need to classify them and even in our scale using an llm is like an Overkill. You are using a expensive solution because the paper tokens, don't imagine a customer tickets. That's that there's a lot of tax, a lot of context that they give.
 And for such specific approach for such specific problem. We still use some classical machine learning models.
 but for the user facing solution, we prefer to use llms because
 The it got more human touch for that you know. So is it just that behind the agent? Like these Spacey models are a tool that the LM can call or is it specifically like a workflow that happens? Yeah, it's a
 Although it's in the same context like customer success, but a two different problems that we're trying to solve one of the damn is open.
 The customer problem. Like I have a problem with my account with my cars. I can access my cars.
 But also we need some very very powerful reporting inside for the customers. So use a for that we use machine learning model for that. Like we can we can talk to the customer success team and say this is the
 The most common calls people are getting touched with hot march to solve. So don't use. We don't need to use elements for that because we have inches reaction, we can use text classification and things like that. So if you have
 A huge amount of volume like ticket customer tickets.
 Maybe.
 You can use classical approaches or even small language models. That's something that's getting getting in the track.
 But that's some, that's a bad point for us had hot month because it's small. Language, mods are really good but when it comes to a multilingual much language, they suffer a lot. Yeah. And for those who don't know what is basic, we are busy all around the road, we have offices in Colombia and Spain. We have offices in Asia, and North America, things like that, but mostly or operations in Brazil. So, most of our customers needs are in Portuguese and for that, this is small language models. A lot, you know, yes, special compared to your Baseline, which is a very Advanced spacy model, it's like, okay, and that's true. And this model was around before the llms. And honestly, one of his two things that we made, when LMS,
 Became a thing was, can we replace this classical machine Learning Without alarms? Because if we have some benefits from that like it's cheaper, right? It's very fast because we can make for instance, using some classical approaches.
 But what's the problem that we have?
 Continuous training, new things, arise is new subjects, new topics people talking to different things, so we need to a good workflow, a good pipeline to keep training this model. We need to evaluate this model, we need to make sure that there is not a like a data drift or concept to drift so at the end of the day, is about trade-offs. Yeah. Like I have this
 This technological effort that I need to do to create this solution. But I got a better quality, a better more accuracy instead of using Nella, limb, or a small, even a small language model. Are you hosting the
 Classical ml model on gpus or do you not know that we don't? So that's another consideration. It's like maybe with a small language model, you could load it on to CPU. But yeah, but we we lost when we need to scale the solution. Yeah. Like you can do it for one two data points. But when you think like an operation of thousands of tickets for per day, it makes something feasible. Exactly. But so we are using classical approaches like the, as I mentioned, the Google learning class approaches.
 And they are running our own infrastructure so they are running basically in kubernetes and a Microsoft microservices. So it's it's really cheap to create the solution. As I mentioned, there is an effort to keep training this model, but when you put in the balance when you make the trade off it is to pay off. Yeah. And then the
 entity extraction or all of these insights, from these models, are being
 Routed to some kind of a dashboard. So you can tell when things are spiking, like I imagine if
 All of a sudden everyone's calling in about the same thing. You're getting alerted for that. Yeah. Oh, you have some insights in, I would say, in a flight bases, in online business, like we have this monitoring for the teams that win. Something is getting out of hand, but mostly, I think it's for generating, insights intelligence for their strategy. Like, imagine that I said to you, the
 Hey, let me do is we have a lot of problem with our payment system.
 So that's an insight for you for the next quarter you can get in touch with the payment solution team is to say, hey there is a spike in this problem. This problem related to our payment project to play payment platform and to solve it because one of the business metrics that we are using a lot, we keep tracking is NPS. So the net promoter score, we need to keep track that. The satisfaction of the customer is, it's good enough for the, for the company. When when we scale our business, when you create new Solutions and things like that. Yeah. Because at the end of the day, your customer,
 Has a very loud microphone because your customer is. Yeah, in some way, shape, or form an influencer or bigger small. Right? Yeah, that's true. And as a mentioned, it can bring
 Some risks for the company like, especially branding risk. So, imagine that to create a solution that impacted negatively, the the customer the customer complaints and we don't know that there is a pain in there that we need to to solve so. Yeah, that's that's important of such simple approaches but powerful outcomes that the solution brings to the table. So what other kind of use cases, are you guys doing? I and I love this one because it's so fascinating to me how your leveraging, both the LMS and
 you try to kill the spacy model, but, you know, still is better. And the consideration of, hey, Portuguese is a really big factor. Speed is a really big factor. And costs are huge, makes a ton of sense to me.
 What are some other use cases that you're putting into production? Talking specifically about Asians one great music is that we have Hawk Martin as well. Do we call Hot tutor? That's basically a digital teacher for your students.
 So imagine you, are you still create like Demetrius decided to launch on a courses on how to grow an amazing hair if you like that.
 I mean, it's not a bad honestly now that you're saying and I should do that but, you know opportunity. Yeah, exactly. I'm leaving money on the table.
 Continue. So, if you have my attention,
 So I meant that to create this course and people try start buying, sometimes people might have some specific questions that you are lessons of things like that are not specifically.
 Teaching them.
 Or they wouldn't pay attention to the classes when we are talking in the video. So we make this AI tutor that basically 24/7 teacher online teacher that we have that. You can ask questions about the course about Demetrius cars. And this model, it's basically a llm with Rag and other things like vector stores that we use fall backs and things like that luxury as well.
 And these AI agent will use only your content.
 True answer the question for your students, so you don't have any any chance of this model getting their information as their or something that you didn't he didn't say. Yeah, like in answering the question.
 So this is has been a massive success at hotmart because people are getting a lot of support for for their purchasing. Because
 when you are a digital creative, some people are a business of one person and we have, like, thousands and thousands of students who can
 Help in all of them at once. So when you use an AI system like that, you can delegate a lot of these questions that a machine can answer based on the content that you already created. And for the Creator. What we we create, what we deliver is not only this experience to delegate this task to to an AI agent.
 But we got we deliver a lot of insights of what people are asking. Yeah. For the actor. So you're analyzing those conversations that are happening and just like, with the support bot, hey, it looks like everybody's asking things about the payments system. Yeah, or there are some funny funny interactions interactions that we see in these in this AI tour. So we have to experience, right? The experience for this student asking anything they want about the
 the course and insights for the the Creator and you can imagine things like an online courses for
 I don't know personal life, like relationships. It happens a lot like people use the AI tutor as our as he
 Therapist. You know like oh I don't know what I'm doing for my life. I I don't know if my wife is still loves me, something like that. So in I believe and there's a lot of risk in there too. Yeah. Because that's why you need to graduate. Yeah. Because you can imagine like AI Asian.
 Directly to this person in.
 You know, it's not not a romantic relationship but in something like a Sentimental interaction. Yeah. It's really important to have good graduates to make sure that they I say hey I can help you with that but it's not part of the course. Yeah. The course, actually, it can be part of the course. Yeah, I imagine like a relationships online. Course, I will help you to be a better version. A better man in my relationship. Yeah, in the relationship. I also need that one. Yeah, there's a lot of courses that I need. I hopefully can make enough money from my hair course to buy these other courses. Anyway, but that's it. Like you have the contacts that is relationship, of course is, but even in that context, the AI agent can't answer something like, like that, they can use this AI agent can use your course if you
 Don't something like related to how to become a better man for you like that they can use but if it's something all over the contacts we have some strict guidance to not.
 To make it in, don't talk about it. Yeah but this is an edge case. Most of the use case that we have our courses related to
 personal development. Like I want to learn this new skill and learn a new language. I want to learn how to become a developer something like that. So but
 The devil is in this edge cases and we need to be very careful for that. Yeah. Yeah, I believe and so when you're analyzing this stuff then you give it to the Creator and you give these Creator Tools in a way and say, look, lots of people are asking this question. You should probably create a new module. Exactly. That adds to the course, and explains this better or re-record this section, because people get to video three and that's the same question exactly. That's that's exactly what we did. The kind of intelligence that we want to deliver to for the Creator because some times they don't have this visibility. Yeah, what what they know about the students is like, oh okay, the meters made the purchase of my course, I'll deliver my cars but that don't know how the experience has been for this person now he know because of the interaction they make with a tutorial and me as the person who bought that course.
 I get to see, I get to interact with the course, in a way that it's not. Like, I feel like I'm bugging the Creator. Yeah, I imagine that. I wouldn't ask the same questions directly to the Creator. As I would ask to the AI agent Creator. That's, that's an interesting point of view, because, yeah, that's true. Imagine the four person that was shy. A person that doesn't have, so I wouldn't want to make him feel bad, but if I know it's an agent, I'm gonna be like, what the hell's going on here. You know, you asked for it, they said, hey, great question, you know, okay, real quick. If you happen to find yourself in the South Bay on March 3rd, we're gonna be taking over the Computer History Museum for our coding agents conference. That's right, we're organizing another conference. This despite me telling myself so many times after we did our AI quality.
 Conference that I would never do another conference because of the stress that it caused somehow I seem to have broken my vows because the pool was too strong.
 I have been.
 Falling in love with all of these new ways to code and use coding agents. So, I wanted to organize a place where we can learn from the best in the game at how they are getting the most out of them. Some of the notable speakers that we have already announced our CID friend of the Pod and co-creator of Claude code, Harrison chase, the founder of Lang chain Thomas reamers, the founder of graphite who just sold it to cursor, good old decks, the founder of human layer and the dude who popularized the term Context, Engineering, and harness, engineering. And last but not least, someone I consider a very close friend. Michael Eric is going to be doing a workshop. He's a Stanford lecturer. And actually he was a past co-host of this here podcast that you're listening to you know, before he got all famous and stuff.
 Come join us, it's intimate by Design. There's only 450 people that were gonna let in to the room to try and keep the signal as high as possible. We've got early bird pricing happening until February 1st.
 So I'll see you there. Something that's really being working from the best. Two years, we launched the 2023. So if you're remember like chat to PPT was launched in November 2022, November 2022,
 and we launched less than a year, the AI tutor and
 I think it's the most important when we think about an AI agent.
 You need to.
 Think not only about the hype. There is a lot of high pressure to create AI systems create AI features but you need to pay attention on how you measure the sex of your AI agents in production. So how success looks like when we think about AI tutor, hot material that we created
 Something that's really important for us is direct feedback from the user. So each question that they tutorial answer, there's a thumbs up thumbs down so people can interact with that. And it's
 Amazingly, positive, they're exception because they consume in a course. I think it's about context because I'm here learning this. This course learning this lesson.
 I make a question in my question. Get answered correctly. So that gives me some some satisfaction of okay, that's cars. That course is really good for me, right? And also something that really important for us is like the engagement of the solution. Yeah. Not only engagement. But okay, you talk to Once to to
 Tomorrow here, are you going to talk to them tomorrow as well? Like how people are repetitive asking things to her? So one metric that we like to use is how much people are interacting in a weekly basis with the AI tutor. If these people are coming back and asking another question because you can have people that like 100% of your user base as common question, but the answer is so bad that they don't come back, they don't question anymore.
 So these are some of the metrics that we pay close attention when we deliver user-facing Solutions, like the eye tour that has a huge impact on the student experience, and need to pay attention to make sure that this this new solution creates a better experience for them but also aligns with the strategy of the company in a way that metric on if a user comes back and how much they're using it throughout the week or the day.
 Is a proxy for how much value they're getting. Yeah.
 That's exactly because you can understand one problem that we tried to solve with AI to the as well. It's like, there is a drop engagement and not a follow-up for only for heart mart, but any digital platform you can think of YouTube like that people. You know that you are, you have a YouTube channel. You you see that there is a lot of Engagement in the beginning of the of the video and they drop. So one thing that do we need we want to make sure is that
 is the attention with the retention bigger for for person for
 Courses, that use the hot martyr and we measure you measure that. Like, let's compare a course that doesn't use.
 Tutor. And of course, the uses to learn for for their students.
 and the different was,
 Absolutely immensely like people, that use their hot mud turtle, they come back in, keep their attention higher than people that don't use. Because I try to understand why this effect. And I think it's something because we have a new touch like then just looking at a screen and just saying yeah maybe you get lost and everybody learns differently.
 I am also have heard stats where
 the majority of people who buy courses never finish them. Yeah, that's, that's, that's, that's, that's true. I think not only for digital courses, but yeah, if you go to college you can think of massive degree doctorates and things like that. And yeah, that's a problem that we are trying to keep in the retention to make sure that the courses is delivering value for their Journey for their Learning Journey.
 And I think it's Solutions like AI agents. Can bring some imagine when you are learning something, when you are watching a video, it's
 It's a passive interaction. I'm just there. Consuming that video
 Once I have an interface that I can interact with, I move from this passive interaction active interaction. I'm making questions, I need to think of the question that I'm going to make. I need to have at least some kind of critical thinking of the question that I need to formulate for that. I think that improves a lot. I can I can tell you because this is the way that I like to to learn. Yeah, I mean to, I was one of those guys in the classes that escalated questions to the to the teacher to that he's recently hands. So, make some questions. I think we can have a little bit of that with AI agents in and educational Feud, by interacting me questions that can be answered using the context of the whole course that I use. Yeah, it shows that you try to grow the greater theme or the greater concept that is being shared. It's not just like sitting back.
 Seeing how much you understand and then ultimately doing nothing with it. Yeah, that's true. And that's the good thing that we we extract from this music. Is that
 We see that for the education educational industry.
 AI agents can make a major major role in the
 Experience the student experience throughout this journey.
 So we basically made more investments, in AI agents, not only AI agents, but AI as a whole to create a new features for our users to create a new features of how they can create their own agents. And I think true three, three months ago, we launched it Asian as a product
 That's basically.
 Just like you can create an online course you can create a new book, sell them a hot Mart. We also offer the opportunity to use to create your own agent at heart and start selling this. This agent.
 So the good part is that you can use your own knowledge base like you as you have an online courses on how to do if your hair and things like that. There is a lot of knowledge in there that we can use lots of podcasts about my hair routine. Yeah, of course. That's true. So why not create an agent? Using that knowledge base? It's not like a generic charity, agent that you can ask him anything. It's
 A Demetrius agents.
 They put his knowledge in this agent that they are using to create better answer, helping me with something. So we have people that are creating agents
 Imagine like nutritionists things like that. They are creating agents to help you with your, with your diet, create some, some recipes for you based on what you learn from the course,
 yeah, so the AI the agent as a product has been used as an opportunity for
 upselling. Like you buy the course and you get and AI agent that you can use on hot Mart or in WhatsApp and things like that. And there's a there's a lot of opportunity. There we are seeing some great results from some major creators that we had in, you know, industry and we see that in 2026, we are going to invest that more because this something that the world is going, this is the way they do. The world is going. It's not only about
 Online course, since I feel like that but also using agents to create new products and your experience. Yeah, that interactivity makes a lot of sense. How have you seen the difference in ecosystems or in platforms from the ml platform that's supporting the spacy models and you're just retraining and you have the evaluation there, that's pretty. It's I'm not gonna say it's totally understood how evaluation works there. So then going to these AI products and maybe you're just hitting an API. But yeah, you're trying to evaluate by looking at the different current turns in the conversations that users are having or the questions that folks are asking.
 I think the beaches lesson that we we get from that is that you need to when you work with AI agent platforms, you need to be ready to change everything that created so far because the foods the industry is moving so fast. Like I like to give you the example of chain of thoughts or reasoning models. Yeah.
 As I mentioned, PT was launched in November and they launched the API in March 2023. And at the time, we created this AI agent for customers success and we need something that later became reasoning models. Like the, we need a model to think about what they are going to do at a time, even structured output was so hard. It was almost impossible to make an llm to just spill out and Jason for for our application. So this one was one of the last in Miami, telling you that
 I mentioned that we are using machine learning models since 2015.
 And, at the time we had a very strong machine learning platform with MLB team and they feel like that. So, we were so improvements related to their extraction, like, feature stores, we are, we were using experiment platform like mlflow to create experiments to deal with the whole life, cycle of this models continuous training pipeline is using, I don't know. Serverless gpus, anything like that. This were problems that a machine learning platform needed. So,
 Then Jenny I comes out. So then appears in, and we saw it like everything that we made so far.
 Yes, we can. We can use some of them but we need to create a lot of new things that we didn't, we weren't playing. I think the pictures example are rectal database. Yeah but it was looking for rectal database at the time. Like if you are not on search ancient team so she and a recommendation team we are not paying attention to that.
 So we need to evolve this machine line exclusively platform for a machine learning plus AI, Jen AI platform as well.
 So the first experience was like something that said, like it was an API that people call use some components of this API. Oh, I have this mod this
 AI, this prompt that I want to use right again. So you can call this API to use as llm layer Vector database.
 but they keep it, we need to keep it involved because we
 We showed value from this the solution, and we need to evolve creating new features. It brings me the experience. So we need to put to create components for graduating. We need to create components for fallback. Like, if my vendor, there's a problem with my vendor, I need to use another vendor to. So the user doesn't have any problem.
 and now we are seeing some problem even if that infrastructure we are reviewing this infrastructure to make it better for
 Internal solutions that recreating like AI tutor the hot man tutor.
 But also for the external clients like allowing digital creators to create their own agents using the same platform. So we don't have two ecosystem that we need to take care of.
 So, but this is, I think it's almost impossible to
 Plain for this, this environment, we didn't see the come because even the industry was not read for that.
 So, this is something that we need to pay attention. When you are creating a platform is
 You need to make every part of your platforming every company. Very dependent of each other. Yeah. Like at the beginning we use it. Some of these Vector database vendors imagine like Penny coin or something like that but we need to move to our own infrastructure.
 At the end of the day, was just to change the endpoint in our AI platform because that the vector storage was not attached to the platform itself, which was just a component. So I think that's some learnings that we had throughout this experience. You gotta be ready to burn it all down, basically. Yeah. And or at least make some major changes in these in this infrastructure. Well, yeah, I even
 know, a lot of people who know are like,
 We don't really care so much about Vector databases because we just want to give our agents the search capability. I see. Yeah. And let so the agents can call a tool which is search and then they figure out how to get what we need in stead of like
 Everything is now going to be run through the vector DB, or it's going to be vectorized and then thrown into the vector DB and all of that stuff, exactly Vector storage. It's a good amount of effort that you need to put you maintain an infrastructure like that. Even if you're using like something like both degrees or open search, there is an infrastructure that you need to take care of. And I I get the people that say like we don't need regular don't need Vector database. But when we think like, when we think in a case, such as I mentioned, a hot martyr that uses the Creator's knowledge. To answer a question you can use, you can just use a Search tool for that because that that information is not publicly available. It's something that I created for the course that I'm selling. Yeah, they're called the community that I'm creating. So I think that the answer that you need to have both. Yeah, you need to have both. Actually, you need to create some good tools for these
 for this platform and be ready to when things change. I think the best example was mcp's. Yeah.
 It's not even one year, they launched in the mCP in everything. Now is mCP like an MP so much to talk about it at surgery. Yeah. Do you think about Asian protocol Google launched in April, April or May something like that? So it's really, really knew what will be in the next year. You need to be ready to to adapt to your platform for new needs that you need? Yeah. It's almost like don't let the systems around the AI products get to entrenched. Yeah. Because
 You got to be nimble. Yeah, I think the main point is that you need to isolate the problem. What's the problem that we're trying to solve this solution? So we don't feed the, the tool in the, in the problem we need to find what's the best to the best solution for that. That the problem that we are facing, it's called ability problem. It's low latency problem. Yeah.
 These are things that we really knows. When we are creating this systems,
 So for a person asking a question for hot material, latency might be not a problem. Like yeah, I imagine we interact with right? I use perplexed a lot and I don't use the search component anymore. I just use the research because I don't care if my answer takes one minute or two. Yeah, the right answer. I don't care.
 But imagine that we're creating a sales agent.
 For example, they need to read some leads, some code leads and things like that for them. Maybe latency is really important because, yeah, or it's coaching you in the call and it's suggesting that for you to say, it has to be real time. Yeah. Or even a text-based, like mention, I'm AI agent, contact to you from through WhatsApp or telegram. Do you want a sales agency to spend like two minutes think in the next message for a person that is not probably doesn't want to talk to you? Like I what is there a say? This person says agent talking to me. I don't want this product anymore, like that. Something funny happened to me, six months ago, I asked deep research for a report on different GPU providers and it was absolutely shit. I couldn't figure out what each nio cloud value prop was so that set me off on my latest side quest of creating a practitioner's guide to choosing gpus. I'm happy to announce
 This guide is now ready to see the light of day and you can download it for free. Right now by clicking the link in the show notes, we've already got some community members feedback of what they wish. They would have known before signing a gigantic contract and I would love to hear from you if this provides any value or you have some things that the rest of the community should be thinking about when they're on the market for gpus. Go ahead. Download that resource right now. Completely free. It's in the link. In the show notes. These are I think this is the beauty of this AI agency H. Music is a different challenge. Doesn't need your face. Yeah. And recognizing which challenges the most important and which pieces are the most important for you. It feels like you.
 Have spent many cycles on that you're looking at, okay.
 Here's the most important metrics that we want to focus on and here is how we're going to think about them and how we're going to isolate them and try and move towards moving the needle on them. Exactly. And I think one of the business skills that a data, professional AI, professional developer can have in holidays, is a good discernment in everything that's going on because, you know, you know, well that it's really easy to get high for everything that they announced in the line. Oh, this new tool is so amazing. This is changes everything now they are. So doing we are back being like that. I think that the last one that they notes that was with two, you know. Tune. They want to feel like that's somebody else yesterday and event. Like are you guys using tune? It was just the speakers just said, no, no.
 Secondly.
 Everybody's talking about it. But what's the point is, does it really solve a problem for you? Like it's really the yeah. Do you have that problem? Yeah. Bad enough. Exactly where you need to spend the effort to figure out how to use tune. And I can make I would bet money for saying that nobody's using to right now except for Twitter is actually and Linkedin. Everybody's using too many things like that, but the real problem that we're trying to solve are way bigger than the structure output, that response talk to me about some of the other use cases you have
 I mentioned the, I say agents that we have.
 What problem we are, right? So there's a lot of
 Before that hotmart owns his own payment platform. We have hot paid that's our payment system. Specifically for the greater economy and people might ask well why do we need to a specific payment system for the greater economy? The truth is that there's a lot of problems that other players doesn't want solve because you need to when you are using check out to for your community, you want to make sure that you can track to the needs for the person that is going to the checkout. If things like that, you want to have control. What why people are dropping out that say, I've been done by the Abundant on the
 car and things like that.
 And well with these platform long time ago.
 and,
 one problem that we had was,
 People sometimes.
 Get into the sales page, learn everything from the course. Like we know that what this course is teaching, okay, he's teaching this technique this approach. I this is the price this is the time I will have to use this content. Go check out but I don't, I don't, I don't finish the, I don't finish the purchase.
 and as you can see that impacted the approval rate of the of this, this product, and probably that we were trying to solve is just trying to recover these people, that abandon their charge,
 So we developed this AI sales agent actually have, we have some interactions before you even using humans agents to read each one of them like okay yeah no it's like so there is an actual human. It was an action human that was talking to the other human. Yes. Exactly true through what's happening. In this case that's a major messaging platform that we use in Brazil. Yeah.
 And we the good thing is that we could use some baseline for the solution that we need to. So we know what was the response time for humans? What was the compression rate? So, we had this Baseline. So can we create an AI agent that will do the same the same job? And
 Having a better approval rate in that sense.
 So we created these AI saves agent. That's non-profit that we need we had at the time, it was the latency. As I mentioned, it's really important. When we talked to try uni try to close a sale. It's really important. Timing is very important because I want to reach you and maybe you are going to reply just two hours later and I can't just answer your question. Two hours later, I need to be very on it. Yeah, when you're on line, catch, you gotta catch him. Exactly in that moment. So I think that was a good benefits of this AI agent and
 We deployed this model in production, I think in July.
 And it improved, the approval rates of the customer buy a lot. I honestly like, I can't share a specific numbers of these solution yet, but we saw some of these creators improving their revenue.
 From the sales that AI agents make. Because what we what this AI says, is basically using, we are using context from the course. We know what the course is teaching, we know the payment methods, they offer warranties support and things like that. And we created some a workflow that can answer any questions that they use, might have any object action. They will use in my head before the closest save.
 So, in an experience sounds like this.
 You receive a message in WhatsApp from our association and saying something like that. Hate me today. I know your name even know your name because you are logging the platform.
 So I tell you, hold me. I saw that to try to buy this course but you didn't finish your your purchase. What what went wrong do we need help if anything.
 And some we have been tracking some of these interactions. It's something is really good things. Interesting things happens. Some people say oh I will wait for my for my son because they they know everything about computers and they he can help me to finish the sale because they're afraid of fraud or something. Yeah, probably something like that. I want to put their credit card and then exactly, and that's a need to break this objection. Yeah. Like okay. It's it's okay to wait for somebody. Do you don't know how to use a credit card? You have a question about the course. Oh, I don't know if this course, is is true. I don't know the platform. I don't know how much and they start breaking this objection. Like, oh, what does the little company we offer to refund for you? If you don't like the course is, and so people get more
 Interestingly, in the solution in the, in the product and some of them finished the appreciates, everything after this direction, but can they purchase right there in WhatsApp? Exactly, really came. They can if the problem we have some feature called Best Buy if a person already bought made approaches at hotmart. The second time, we, the second time this person tried to make a sale, we this person doesn't need to feel the forms with his name email. Things like that. We just send a code for your email and we say hey if you don't, do you want to finish this the purchase, just tell me the code and we transfer this experience should what's up. So do much close to save you? Now do you want to buy to buy the course and the person say, yeah, I want.
 So we have this workflow, something like the person want to buy some signals like person wants by, and then we see that this person already made a purchase. And then there, the next interaction with these agent, is he saying you to the clients like, oh, I saw that too. Already bought at Hearts. You don't need to feel out to all of the details. I just sent you a code to her email. Just tell me, tell me what it is. And I finished the same for your right now.
 so this kind of experience we want to deliver for digital creators, so they can just
 Improve their own content, like I don't want.
 Think on the strategies on how to recover a clients on how to try to code, closed sales with some leads, I just want to focus on my content, creating bad Community to create the best course. And we have Solutions. Like I say it AI, tutors AI customers customer service agents. These type of Agents can delegate this tasks that a human usually would do for AI. So I can do in the, this digital Creator take, they can focus on the
 Part that I think that an AI can't do that is great in the best course. Great in sharing his knowledge, with their with their students. How does it work with the agent so that it can have access to?
 The system to know that someone's bot already or to the tools to be able to send the email. All of that. Is it, the agent has tools? Like get user information check, like how do you some of these? Some of these informations are populated in in a low latency database? Like some information that doesn't change that we already know, like, your name, we know your email. What course you try to to buy and this information doesn't change but some of these other contents in need to be like on the flight. I if I make a question about the content
 I need to look for the information in our
 Vector database is in our other knowledge basis to fill out the contact. So they AI, can they? I can use. So yeah, it's on workflow that you use is Agents with tooling.
 But most of the most of them are not. I think that right, the right term is Context, Engineering, like, creating the whole context for that interaction to make more fluid, to make more accurate with what they're using need, you know, 100%. Yeah, I want to say the
 I gotta give you huge props because thanks to you, I say it all the time but I can't say it enough. Dude. When I was starting the mlops community, I found the data hackers community and it was my Guiding Light for the mlms community. It was already an established Community, it was very active. There was so much value being created in there and it was not
 salespeople in their just like driving the conversations, it was real practitioners that were sharing their insights and talking about things, sharing their opinions showing their
 Projects that they've worked on. Yeah. And for me that was the coolest thing ever. And so I just I just distinctly remember some of those first times that I would drop into the day to hackers slack and just be like damn there's so many cool channels in here. I can't keep up with all of them I'm gonna keep tabs on a few of them. Yes and one of them was like the memes in one of the most important it was so cool for me because I got to
 Learn about data science data, engineering machine, learning engineering and simultaneously, like, practice, my Portuguese. Know that's part of the truth and I will say this man. Like, I can't thank you enough because I remember some of the first times that we were doing.
 Virtual meetups in the ml Ops Community which it wasn't even a community. Then it was basically just like we were getting on Zoom calls and it was very very nice and still
 I would post like, hey, I'm gonna be doing this in case anybody wants to come by and you came into one of those posts and you wrote in the thread, like dude, what you're doing is so cool, keep it up. This is awesome. That like, this is true. That's true. And I still like, I vividly remember that like, oh, dude, this guy, who's like the moderator? You like me, the stamp of approval. I was like, all right, I guess I'm gonna keep going, you know? Yes. I mean, the, you know, focusing on one contact. That's a Brazilian ecosystem, but we are reaching a lot of people around the world, and I think that gives us a lot of different connections. We see different approaches for old problems. Yeah. So yeah. Thankful for the words and we are learning together from each other. Yeah. Yeah. If anybody wants to practice their Portuguese and data skills at the same time as actually, it's the data hackers Community, you guys got a podcast, you got a news.
 Letter. I'm subscribed to all of it and yeah but the guests we have some Instagram Pages as well and we are on LinkedIn. We have medium blog. That is collaborative with the community. So people in the community right to the blog post and if they want to to know we made with the meters the first AI translated episode that was so good because my Portuguese was a little rusty, know it was good, it was good, it was a good Baseline. So he moved to the I translated can see how good I is a lot of fun and I appreciate you guys being so patient with me.
 There, I was great.
