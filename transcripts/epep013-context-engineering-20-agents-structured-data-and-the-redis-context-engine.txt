Biggest engineering part of agents for Builders becomes the engine like the Context Engineering. Yeah, and this is my view of what Context Engineering looks like.
 Feature form got acquired by redis. Does that signal the death of the feature store? It doesn't. It's funny because you made this LinkedIn post about this and I was trolling you, you were trolling me a new year, baiting me. So I didn't take the bait one. Like let's talk about where going back to Emma opiates. In general, like, where did emo Ops work and where did it not work? I think the promise of mlops from the early days of fear. Remember was that we were gonna have models everywhere. We're going to be like hyper intelligent apps, where every time you're using an app, you would interactive like hundreds of models. That was the idea. So you needed mlops to be able to operationalize all those models.
 Um, the reality is, is that did actually happen but not because of mlops, it happened because of elements formers came. Yeah, and in Transformers, like, or I mean, or old, but specifically, like GPT style Transformers worked. And that nice thing about them is the bar to get them in Productions, weight lower because there's no, you don't need to train them, they just kind of generically work. So the
 Bar of how much Roi you need to justify doing. It is so low. Yeah and you can just hit an API exactly. So it's just like
 So now where do you actually need or where does it make sense for a business to actually invest to maybe have an entire mlops team, which is an expensive team and it's an operational team. So it's like a team that's whole job is to help other teams do things. So, if you start thinking of like this economics of where that would actually make sense one, it has happened at scale.
 Um, to the the use cases that we see very often. There's many, but the ones that come up a lot one is recommend their systems? Yeah, which makes complete sense. Like if you're recommendations are better, you make more money. There's a very short line between recommendations being better and money and I've replaced UCS fraud same thing if you yeah, screw up. You know, if you're fraud is better, that literally equals money and so and at scale like for every single user of your application or every single transaction that goes through. So that's where we've seen mlops work and we're still seeing to this day. A lot of companies are deploying new features stores. Very doing very existing features stores. We're actually seeing some of the most demand we've ever seen for features stores now.
 And I think that's, that's
 Partly? Because it's forgotten and a bit. And so when in the early days, when people went their own, it's like the maintenance cost of those things is kind of a wide. Did we build this thing when they're all these Solutions out there? Yeah.
 And the maturity curve maturity curve. You start to see that people understand the concept and they realize that it's not just like a postgres database. Yeah, people are starting to really feel the problems and it's it's less like we need this thing because LinkedIn said so and like hype-driven development and we're getting into like this, actually is a huge pain and if we solve this, it would be true Roi. Wait, wait. There's there's things I want to know about the acquisition one being just like, what's it like to sell a company? How much of a pain is it? I've heard due diligence takes years off of your life.
 So in general, I mean, raising around we've raised multiple rounds acquisition, I would say is more intensive then raising around
 It's just it depends I think it depends on a lot of things you can't really say. Um anyway I think the acquisition here, it made sense for a lot of reasons. One being just as a team there's like a DNA match I think of redis. I think we resided known for useability developer experience. It's like really has that Dev love but we really think about a feature forms something that we saw on.
 And I mean the cool thing that acquisition for us is like we got to keep the whole team is there. So the feature from Team came as a whole which formed the product continues, it will continue to exist, it's getting double down on. We're actually getting more resources to keep doing what we're doing and build on top of it. Our product and CP is kind of transforming into something even bigger. We'll have contact center and what we're working on there. And I just think read, this is a company is just in such a cool spot because it's kind of moving and up leveling from becoming just reddish.
 Which again is powerful. It's like Swiss Army enough but it's like providing that platform there to Solutions on top and becoming this kind of
 Ai and ml data platform or a context platform. So I think it's just was the right fit at the right time, and it's just a really good match. And I mean, it's only been a month or so, since it's happened and like, I'm wearing a red sweatshirt, I'm like, I really it just has been even better than I expected. Yeah, I'm stoked for you and hopefully, we'll get to talk to you in two years. And here all about how you've evolved through the company, and all that fun stuff. Yeah. It's, it's, it's, it's, it's really awesome and I think I think that's probably most important part. I mean, my big thing of feedback, it's same with fundraising, like, you're partner who you work with is All American, a lot of companies that have been inquired and the partner in the company that part of. So I was thinking more, like, VC partner, but both like, whoever like, who, who are you working with? Who's like your Champion there. Who is, who cares about this? Are they investing in this are
 Not investing in it. How are they thinking about it? Because you can kind of get your own head like what you want them to think and what is reality. And I think it's really important to go. Figure out what is reality, what is actually happening? So you make the right decision for yourself and your team and your invest and just everyone make sure that it's a all win and unfortunately, that rarely happens and we I think are super fortunate that it did for us. Wait. So red is already had a feature store right or redis was doing stuff. I know, I remember them talking a lot about features stores back in the day, yeah, feature form now is just folding into redis. What is that path? Look like now that you're part of redis. Yeah, so on the feature store part how it looks is this, so read, this is always powered almonds store. So a lot of companies come to us for like we're building a feature store, we're going to use one, maybe we're going to use feature form. Maybe we're going to use Feast, whatever they're gonna or if we're gonna build something in-house, we need an online.
 Store. And rather this is the best for a variety of reasons. But the general,
 A vision is like well why don't we meet our customers and Prospects where we're at? If they're trying to solve this thing? Why don't we meet them there and have a solution for them? That's custom built of redis. So rather than them having to go figure it out. And just use this as a component, we can actually give them the full solution and features feature form. Traditionally was something that played nicely with everybody, right? It was one of those things where you said the engine, the compute the storage. It doesn't really matter. We can just be on top of that. Yes. And that's still true. In fact, we still have customers on like other online stores today and then we'll continue to be true because this is strategy which I really appreciate and this is something that I again really resonated with me and Drew me to the company. Was we want to win on our merits, we don't want to win on, like we own this thing. So, therefore,
 You know, we're gonna like shut off Cassandra support. It's actually, no, let's get in and make it. I mean, the other thing that feature form on the flip side is because it's all unified. It makes it really easy to have like Cassandra next to redis and have both. So you don't have to kind of choose one online store to ever, I don't know. Nice and so then it's like, great. Well, if we get people on feature form, if they just use feature form and pay for feature from fine, I mean it's still rather for lettuce but our view and it's showing to be true is actually now that it's easier to try Reedus.
 You are more likely to one, just try it because you have it. You have a contract of us to get feature form and then we'll show you, we'll put like our kind of our money, where our mouth is. We'll do a comparison on cost, on speed, on all these things, and you'll see that we are actually the best online store for this. And then, for not, you know, for certain use cases. Then that's fine too. I think they call that the Trojan Horse strategy. It is. But I wouldn't say it's, I mean it's it's sure like there's some aspect to that, but I think it's, it's actually what I like is, it's in really good. Faith. It's like, yeah. Like yeah, we want to compete. We want to win. I mean, of course we do like every company does but it's not.
 It's like a let's just make it easier for them to compare not lose due to just like
 You know, walls, that actually limit competition. Like, oh well, like it's so hard for us to move over to this thing. So we can never, we can't, you know, we have to not only be bettering whatever they're using. We also have to justify the move cost and now we don't have to. We can just be like, cool, what's actually better for you and you can choose that. And so it's not just a trojan. Horse is actually a Simplicity to allow the best online store to win and we believe that's us and we've been building towards that for a long time. So talk to me about redis and elastic cache because I'm not sure I fully understand what the difference is between the two elasticache and this isn't true for all the clouds. So I'll talk about last cash like for example on Azure we have Mr. Which is managed Reddit and that actually is redis. That's us. Well, the last the cash they have. There's a fork of redness on the older version of redis and that's actually what's powering elasticache.
 and there's a lot of
 Things like availability, speed, Etc. Even just like General capabilities, redis core redis, redis literally stress 8, recently, like chorus has really pulled away and a lot of places. The other thing, though isn't just redis. The kind of Open Source product that is also read us the company and I think one thing and everything that really is interesting to me about rather this coming in. And then everything, really the vision that I really liked is
 Think of like like feature form and feature stores, like read. This has always been like that Database, The Core database, which people developers have always used. We always loved and that continues to be true, but we're kind of like having this art almost like a platform moment. We're like, cool. What are people using? Write this for, what more can we do to provide more value? Maybe a higher levels of abstractions and solutions for both agents for ML via feature stores and the variety. Like we have Flex which is like a cold sores and SSD, which is really powerful. Especially, actually, for feature you use cases where you might have massive data sets after database. I remember back in the day, we did a whole before LMS came out. We had a vector search or some. I think it was similarity search hackathon, where we were using archived and,
 It was with redis. You know, it's funny is the use cases rexus and actually a lot of vector DBS.
 You know, people think of them as for rag but my sense I actually don't know what's true about this, but I have seen actually just other companies and my sense is actually a lot of Revenue. Still comes from recommended systems for Vector DBS and they'll actually variety because people would think, which is kind of interesting features for, well, you'll do is, you'll generate like user embeddings or either embeddings. And then you'll see, you know, very simple thing. Might be, I have an item in bedding for like a shirt. Yeah. If I do a nearest neighbor search on that, I can get similar
 Shirts. Yeah and so they'll do Canada generation and then rearranging and this is like how to Tower recommenders work. Yeah, I remember the two Tower stuff that you mentioned back in the day. Yeah, I totally had forgotten about that. Yeah. Because I think
 Funny enough. You were the first person to talk to me about embeddings and you had
 What an embedding store is what you were calling it or embedding up embedding Hub. Dude. That was what? Like 2021. Yeah. We were like I think a fish from we were like one of the first Vector databases which is really funny and it's because at that point like three of them so I was just like this needs to exist but I would I couldn't have guessed, is that oh, you know, in like six months or a year this is actually gonna be like super huge Market because of rag and LMS which hadn't even like cross my mind. I go again for Rex's use cases. Because we were seeing people using feature stores for recommended systems so um that's why we build it and it's really funny how that worked out and then we kind of bowed out because it became like a day the base thing and feature form itself we're just born like a true database company. We didn't really have that DNA
 But it's I've always kind of wish we did in the kind of feel very fortunate. Now that like now like there you know those people are call away for me. So I understand the platform idea, I also know that in your talk when we were in London, you kind of broke down this vision of, we've got all of these assets with redis and so now how can we unify them for the new generation of Agents?
 Yeah, I've been calling it Context Engineering 2.0, which I don't know if I love that yet, but that's what I'm going with catchy. It's catchy. I'll work with it. Yeah. Um,
 You gotta find find the hype words. You gotta make new terms together but but really what I'm seeing is
 Okay, so, when we started with LMS, I think from the earliest point, I realized that the only thing not only thing, but one of the most important things is context. And when I think of Context Engineering in rag, actually I always thought like we over, we were too specific. Typically when we talked about rag, be able to talk about rag or like vector DB nearest neighbor, look up on like paragraph chunks based on the user query? That's kind of like what people think when they think Rag and
 But really the problem isn't that? The problem is, I have a context window. It's yay, big. I need to fill it with the most relevant and insightful information. Yes. For llm to be able to do when they need to do and I needed to be also not not relevant because then they can throw again cause hallucinations
 now, it just turns out that are really
 Really good Baseline way to do. This is just grab a lot like a tax Corpus.
 And chunk it up and kind of do rack. So, rag works naively. Just like weirdly. Well, for how, like, kind of you like, Cookie Cutter of a solution. It is it kind of just works well for everyone, but that's just a Baseline. And we're clearly like moving past that and the other parts of contacts have come up, are like memory. It's a big one and I think the newest Frontier is structured data for agent. So it's kind of like
 Kind of his mCP. But not really. I think it's actually a more General concept, which is how do I get? If someone asked me, this could be something as simple as I'm building a support agent. Some of like, why is my originally go and find the order? Find all the information about the order which could be in like postgres. Like, it could be in the structured database, get that into contacts because the agents gonna need it to be able to solve the problem at hand. Yeah, so we have these three things, unstructured, data, memory, structured data. And today if we're going to do that you would build like a rack pipeline here and you would build like a memory service and then you would deploy like some mCP servers and these things don't really talk to each other or almost like kind of disjointed contacts and they're all kind of work differently. And so my sense is
 We should build.
 Relationships between this context like a memory can be associated with a document, there could be a row of data, that kind of points to, you know, a few paragraphs and the rag store, so almost like Knowledge Graph, almost like Knowledge Graph. I don't, like using Knowledge Graph purely because it's so overloaded. And in this space, people immediately start thinking graph rag, which is not what this is and how I would describe it. It's more just
 Treating context as a holistic thing. There's all these indices and like different ways to let's say.
 Retrieve data and you also need some sort of like semantic layer on top to understand that data. I kind of think of it. I've been thinking of it as well, that wish I had was graphql for agents.
 A waste graph draw graphql was kind of one of these things, I was really hyped, but never, I think fully took off and graphql is just a different way of building. Like Ross apis. Rest API is a very like, kind of input output graphql. Allows you to almost create and unify a lot of data from different places and write kind of almost like ad hoc queries and
 The reason why I didn't take off, was this kind of complex to do? It could be slow and humans in general, like, the engineers, like input. I'll put it's much clearer and cleaner to understand. The thing is, is those axes of Freedom or graph will give us is extremely powerful for agents agents. Love having axes of freedom because they can actually take advantage of all that and the speed. So, like, parse the graphql query, you know, doesn't matter anymore because it's I mean the agents to slow part, it's not the, the typically, not the theater, or travel or query. So graphql. I'm trying to wrap my mind around but also how would that even work with agents? So how I imagine it is this you would Define like let's say you're an e-commerce store, you have users, you have items, you have orders, these things are all
 There could be ever tabular but they might also have documents in them, right? Like order might have descriptions, or might have specifications or really a very, there's a mix of things, but it's like, you have attributes and you have relationships.
 So you can Define this whole thing out. You can kind of Define or explain somehow how to get to that data.
 Then you expose this knowledge, graph or semantic graph to the agent so Asian can be like cool, I can navigate and figure out what day that exists. So I can go ask for exactly what I need to be able to resolve. What's a hand, the nice thing there is, there's two parts, one is many parts but one part is
 Control you as the user, can really control the contextual view that the agent has, which you can't do like Texas sequel, which is like a whole. Another thing you can't really do it with API to mCP because you're just kind of stuck to whatever your API has and the surface area of air. Yeah. And so this allows you to build a surface area of that is tailored to agents of like the right, kind of abstractions and semantic layer for an agent. But you see this almost being like an abstraction above all of that stuff? That is behind the veil. It's a single pane in glass. Yeah, so I'm calling it today. I call it, I'm calling it contacts engine but it's a single plane and glass to all of your contacts or that structure that instructure day their memory. So you just connect it speaks emcp, but that this implementation detail, but the agent can connect to this thing and they can go and figure out. Okay, what context exists in the world that I have access to and what does it mean?
 How is it related? How do I get it? They can go and retrieve what it needs in that way. And you're letting the agents figure out the semantic layer on top. So that they understand, or is it humans? That are kind of creating a document that says? Well, this is this data, if you're getting these kind of queries, you should reference this
 yeah, it's written in Python so you do that the developer would write the in Python we could use an agent to help them do it but I think it's really important that the humans kind of
 Build this to control it. So I think that's a lot of what engineering becomes is that for agents, which is again, I think most of the biggest engineering part of agents for Builders.
 Becomes the engine like the Context Engineering. Yeah, and this is my view of what Context Engineering looks like. At least for the next five, ten years interesting. It's more the descriptions and the pointers and the understanding of the data. It's still being intimate with the data and understanding where and what you need, but it's not necessarily writing scripts or writing different functions to get to that data. It's describing that data in a way that an agent is going to be able to understand to get it when it needs it for someone maybe like, if you're listening to this and you want it to maybe see it more clearly we feature form had and still has open source product called in your mcpp, which is widely used for. And it really captures that now, in terms of CP and how is built originally was really generic.
 Up. Now, when you allow redis to become a dependency,
 You get suck because now you get a vector database, you get all of the the abstractions that read this provides underneath the hood, the caching that you might need for apis, all of that stuff becomes part of it. And that's, I think what context engine becomes is like this
 Layer which may be mimics or looks like interchem CP or is that kind of like a continuation of it but with the power of the redness database behind it. Yeah almost like the red is ecosystem because it's I really like how you've shifted my thinking from
 Reddit as this cash and just something that's super fast when you need it to okay. Redis has these other things though and now you can look at it as an ecosystem and how can we use all of the assets that read it? Read has to leverage our agenda use cases. Yes. When you think of why people like reddish
 there's two things one which we talked a lot about speed. She's like well understood rather. This is and will remain pretty much the fastest thing you can deploy for data.
 and,
 Second is the founder is kind of a legend in his own right? Yeah. What was his name Salvatore Salvatore? That's it. Yeah, like
 He's an employee of reducing it. Yeah, he's awesome. So that's the second reason or what was the sound that would be? The third reason that the second reason is the abstractions that people that you have. It's like
 The Simplicity. It's almost like when you look at read this you're like, oh cool. I have all these types of things. I can use like these different types of data structures that are built into write this and that can pick and choose what I want. And it's really, really simple. It's all tax, it's just nice. Like the ux of this is always been really nice.
 And so now you have a really nice ux that's super, it's like Swiss Army knife.
 And like, it does so many things and they all kind of work really quickly. And we'll write this cloud. Like, now you get high availability and all this other stuff. You need for a production setting, so you combine all that. And then you build a layer on top, which is again that kind of almost like data platform for agents, that's kind of where we're going. And I talked about context engine which is a part of it. And I think a big, the point of contacts engine is, hey agents give agents a single pin and glass to get to the date that they need to solve real problems.
 Here other things we do even to like our caching Heritage. Like we have Lain cache which is a lot of people have problems of spending too much money on tokens, right? Alarms are very expensive.
 And when you go look at what people are using like your customer support off for, you'll find that like a massive percentage of questions or like the same thing, 80 20 principal. Again if you were to cash naively you're like oh if it's exact query gets her in it's not going to work for two reasons. One is if someone changes one word and so it doesn't it doesn't match. Two is if someone's like what's the weather today?
 Then, well, you can't use the cached answer. Because yesterday, the weather was different today, so what Lane cash is, is
 It uses actually it uses the vector DB residency, Vector DB under the hood. Again showing building these solution layers on top and it enables us to actually see is this equivalent and we look at a lot of the different axes. There's negation, which is another thing which is like something can be similar, but if you add the word not and it's actually completely opposite. If you're like, you know, what's the weather in San Francisco versus? What's the weather in San Diego? It's like, it looks pretty much the same but that Francisco or Diego is completely changes the the contacts. And so, yeah, I mean, we're just doing all. I mean, there's just so much happening at this and I think the vision is to continue. We've been the Swiss army knife for the webpage for things like sessions rate. Limiting just everything around making web apps reliable fast at scale. I think now like the vision continue to be that and I think that is still a huge part of our business.
 But also thinking of the future and where things are going and I think the future of this is providing contacts to agents.
 What? I am still caught up on, is the single plane of glass and the let's say whether it's enriched MCPE or it is this context engine, how do you basically give the data to the enriched mCP? Is it through tools?
 You mentioned that in Rich, mCP? Obviously it speaks mCP, it's kind of in the name. So as a dead giveaway to give away.
 But is that just like on your side tools? Going into the different databases? Is it? Like, how does that actually work? Yeah, so there's an hmcp but actually talk about more. Like the broader vision of context engine
 so, think of how
 A rack pipeline works.
 You take documents and S3, let's say somewhere.
 You transform them which is just chunking embedding getting in a vector database.
 That.
 Thing you have in the vector DB is actually if you zoom out a little bit, it's this is a materialized view.
 You're projecting documents and S3 into embedding space. And so that's a weird, you know, historically would have been a really weird transformation to do, but it it's the same, it's a materialized view.
 Online stores features and online stores. These are just essentially materialized views.
 And so one aspect is just kind of materializing views that you want your agency to be able to see into redis making those queryable. Reddit has a query engine called our QE which Powers the vector DB and the law of the other stuff search rather search and other things.
 but if you project into redis,
 You can then you explain what are these things and however related Harvey Associated to each other. You may become accessible, but it's not just that because some things you don't want to materialize into redis verb, whatever reason. Um you can still support apis calls or other MCB service like back to when you're projecting into redis. Yeah. And then the agent is going to get that. Is that just through a tool called to redis? It's like, yes, it would be through contacts engine but it would be back by Reds, okay? So we'll just be like, MCPE in the end creates tool calls, and then other way to actually think about what enriched mCP is, or the
 I guess thing behind it. I've talked about the graphql thing. The other thing that I was thinking about was
 For a lot of use cases for mCP. It's really just dated retrieval. Yeah and you find that it's actually very repetitive
 To write these tools sometimes because you have get user list users, get users by, you know, you kind of end up with like, very repetitive code and, and just a very kind of annoying to write code base and Bloated and Bloated. But if you do it from the day, the first
 So Define the schema first and then kind of attach the mCP stuff on top, you end up of MC. It's still again becomes a set of tools, it becomes an mCP server, but it is Data. First you start with the data and you define the mCP server from data. First that becomes tools as a tool first and then trying to kind of map that to data. So the data first, as in, you understand the data,
 You see what the data is almost like trying to tell you and going back to this, maybe we can use the store example, online store.
 As a perfect example where you've got different skus, you've got descriptions, but you've also got numbers and orders and all of that. Yeah.
 You see that you are embedding all of these descriptions or the skus or you could embed things. But no, a lot of it is just like, gets because that's the thing is like a structured data, not everything has to be. Like, I've seen people do things like
 they have, they put into Json, they do like a nearest, like a, like a rag on top of Json documents, which is
 Doesn't work for variety of reasons. It's also just not natively, how you would typically want an agent to access that kind of data search has this place in the powerful for agents. But it's not that answer to everything. I think we've gotten to the point where we have a hammer and everything looks like a nail. Yeah. So it's not just embedding things, it's more like
 An orm if anyone's ever like used an orm. In fact, like inner temp, CP supports SQL, Alchemy directly if you have a SQL Acme around, you can actually just turn that into and enrich, mCP server. And so an orm if someone's not familiar is
 You would have your, you would Define your database, schema as classes in Python, okay? And then you define what each field is, and like the type and, like the indices that you would have on it and then, rev writing SQL, queries yourself, you kind of interactive it as you would in Python and it under the hood, it'll just Maps down the SQL queries. But when you're in the python layer, it feels way. More natural to work of classes and data objects. And so, in order to just kind of the same idea, it's much more natural for mCP, which is really just data. Retrieval to think at the classes and data retrieval function layer, then the writing, you know, tools that just run ad hoc queries or whatever. One thing that I saw in the talks yesterday was that
 Json.
 Consumes a ton of tokens. Yeah. And when you're trying to search or you're giving agents tools to search or just you're giving them access to data,
 A donate was talking about how they switched to CSV and it consumes way less tokens and therefore, is faster and cheaper and all the benefits, right? Yeah.
 In this case though, I'm not sure how you would look at that. It wouldn't even be that you're giving.
 The data like that to the agent or you would could but it doesn't it's like would some people do that they'll dump an entire CSV to the agent. Yeah I've seen this before people will build this giant object and they'll just dump all because they don't know how to make the agent, go find structure data. So they'll just dump all the structured data that they think is relevant just into the prompt itself. And then in that case, it becomes really important to like optimize those sort of things.
 but my sense is, oh, always been that wrapper then
 One shot queries, where you just go and grab as much context as possible based on some query and just throw it into the context window. The correct way to build agents, for a lot of use cases is actually, don't do that. Let give the agent an interface that window to go. Find a. They didn't need when it needs it. Like the agent is plenty intelligent, right? And nowadays out are so smart and it's very rare.
 Like you're very unlikely to have a use case that you're building an agent Forum, where the agent isn't smart enough. The issue has is almost always the system, the context. Yeah, it doesn't have the right information or data to be able to do something smart even code generation, right? Like, a lot of people complain like, oh like you know, users to try catches. We don't like doing that or our Styles different and it's not like the agents wrong, you know, the code that generates is likely good and fine. But it doesn't have all of the context about how you like your style guy and all these things that needs to do well or it's like oh it didn't know. It made up a function or API that doesn't exist at hallucinated that and my sense is like well it's probably it's like pretty much skimming your code and it's guessing what functions should be their chances. Are that function probably should be in your API if a hallucinated it. And if it can't be in your API, then that's more of again. It's a context thing. There's a
 Some stuff it's missing. It doesn't really understand. It's not like if you didn't give it enough information it wouldn't be able to reason about your stuff, it just doesn't have that and some of the problems like how do you get that to it? And the way that's efficient without just dumping your entire code base in the context. Yeah, so when you say, hey, that function doesn't exist, you hallucinate it, it responds and says, you're welcome. Yeah. Well, I am serious. Like I do this. Sometimes it will hallucinate the function and I'll be like oh actually you know that function is actually probably fine having on the library. I just didn't think of it or didn't bother implementing it and I was like, go make it and like that's solely fine. Yeah, no mistakes. No mess up. Okay, so I think there's a
 Fascinating thread. To pull on here, with the
 Ways that you're using search right? And the ways that you're exposing the context, the right context at the right time. We heard it last night. A bunch how
 you just because you have access that doesn't mean you have like intelligence yeah to the right type of answers and
 I think you're hitting on that point, and that's why rag, was a disaster because it was like, oh, just embed everything, throw it in the vector store. And then we give access to the vector store. We give the llm access to it, and it's Off to the Races, but then you're like, okay, how much do we chunk? Where do we break the chunks? And it starts getting really confusing.
 And that's exactly. Why is that? We're we need to like almost dynamically be doing this and
 Instead of saying rag is the solution? Let's just give agents the Search tool when they need it. Yeah, if they need it and then we can also give them other tools that are going to be valuable at the same time. The first is iteration of rag where alums that didn't run in a loop which means that they were not really able to like make tool calls and do all the things that you might want to do.
 What they would. So what you would do if you have one shot one pass.
 Is you're like, well, okay. I need to just put everything possible into this prompt and so given that problem statement,
 Um, Bragg was a good way to solve that, but now we're past that, like, we can really trust. I mean, yesterday, when we were at the conference, and there's some point where I needed to move from one library to another library and I literally let it run and ran for 10 minutes and it came back and it had all my tests passing. I was shocked but this thing ran for 10 minutes and did it all for me and got all working. So,
 I mean if you get an agents are on the loop, actually I heard this thing from anthropic where they're saying about the metric for tracking, nowadays is more about. How long can you trust an agent to work independently a autonomously without, you know, a human intervening and still making forward progress. What were they calling it? Yeah, last night they were talking about, it was like, Interruption a mount of interruptions or something like that. And so if you're interrupted it, then that trust and that metric is lower right? Yes, I think I actually didn't see that talk yesterday, but I think that it's all referencing the same thing. Yeah, that's a way to track that is that they killed a job and they killed a job. That means that it started doing accounting off the rails. Yeah. Or it's just was got confused. And so, that's a metric to track. And then, if you're tracking them metric, they're saying it's doubling. I forget what they said. If there's ever six months, or every year, doesn't really matter. If I could just doubling is nuts. Because let's say today, you know, it's
 Yeah, a few minutes like five minutes is what I got. Yes, sir, I got 10 but let's just say it's five minutes. Okay, that's fine. But if we're at 30 minutes in a few years, like how different is that going to be?
 So and when you start thinking like okay well I need something to run the 30 minutes, it's not like you can just leave it with thoughts for 30 minutes and it's just gonna do something really smart, you kind of need to give it a lot of access.
 To data Internet, all these things like House Pro work. Like the way. So smart. Is that like like a GPT Pro? Yeah. Is that if you watch what's doing it's really just going in like searching the web. Yeah. If you didn't let search the web and just sat there and thought and kind of in the loop, I might do better, but I just don't really think it would be a lot better. Yeah. Wouldn't be that useful. Yeah. It's it's probably it's more powerful.
 To just give access to. It's just context. It's all, I mean, it's so funny because like we say the word so much. It almost sounds like a almost like doesn't sound like a real word anymore, but it's just all that madders is context. And if you can build proper context, you can get it to work. And this person now, you know, people are thinking about small Mall. There's a lot of things people are thinking about but that will always be true. The better context, you have the better results you're going to end up with
 so, talk to me about and say,
 I would love to talk about mCP, MVP is like, on super pay. Is it is a dirty word and in the LinkedIn world? I think now, that's whenever I see you online, whether it's on X or LinkedIn people talking about mCP, I just insert that voice and remember like yeah, this is the hype word of the moment. So MCPE
 It is.
 You know, the funny thing about mCP is really all it is is like you're moving tools remotely. Now why that matters? I think the thing that people Miss is, what clothes things so simple. I already had tools. Whatever like why are we doing this new McPhee thing? We already had to rest. The idea is this one like just tool Discovery all this. There's like all these Concepts that exist in mCP, but don't exist in rest. Some people would argue will couldn't we just build on top of rest. Insert is
 Probably, but For Better or Worse, we've all kind of standardized around mCP and that's important because getting anthropic and open AI to agree on something. A standard in having all the Enterprise companies kind of come and accept it as as the way forward, that rarely happens. So, that's a big deal and what it's doing and it's almost. This is, It's So such a minor change in some ways. It's like, we're putting the tools in that in a server. That that's the only way you could actually make something. So Monumental happened on standards.
 What mcps actually doing? Let's
 think about what it actually means at scale and Enterprise scale to do mCP. Well,
 With it, turns into is.
 You're separating the agent from the context layer essentially, and you are enabling teams to build and maintain in parallel, and mCP servers which are really against the state access or tool access that any agent can come and connect to and give value from. So it's actually like an engineering. So it's like microservices, yeah. It's all it's almost like databases. Like you now have access to my database or my in on another way. You can look at my knowledge like here's my knowledge base, I can
 Just have this for you. Yeah, I mean yes, and and there's other piece of it which is like we how did we do this before? Well, we just put these tools directly into the agent. The problem is like organizationally that doesn't scale. Like if you're doing many agents, you don't really want, you know, to be installing libraries or maintaining libraries and then trying to like kind of fit these into every single agent separately. It's much cleaner to just say connect to these five things that you have access to and we start thinking of off and discover and all these other things. It just becomes a lot more scalable.
 So we have a large team to have all of these mcpn points and even in the small team,
 It's just like you're just creating a separation of concerns. There's the agent how I think of it is like where is the agent and like a language or whatever you use. There's kind of the agent framework, which is really explaining how the agents, what should be doing, which agents exists, how they should be thinking, and what they should be connecting to.
 There's a context engine, which is again, providing the window to the data which is typically backed by apis data. Maybe I'm CPS and that's that's again the thing that we are inventing and have it right? As
 And then on the other side, there's that limit itself. And so those are the three components of an agentic system where the agent workflow, the context workflow and then down a line workflow and
 That's it. So that's it. I mean, that's all it is, like, all I need is, is it's a, it's a llm running in some sort of, like, scheduled Loop or orchestrated Loop that gets data. It needs to be able to solve hard problems. So it's really just taking this powerful thing which is an llm and turning it into actual Enterprise solutions to do that. You need to give access to ability, to do things and ability to learn things and then you need something to like. So if you have multiple agents multiple tasks, you just need to give it a system prompt for perhaps, you have a few different agents that create separation of concerns there to really interesting but maybe conversation for another time. But that's it. It really is that simple. And so, if you separate the mCP layer or just a contact layer and endpoint apis away, from the agent layer, it makes it way easier to be able to kind of iterate on these things.
 Separate of each other. It's not like, oh, we added a new API. We want to change the sign. I need to go, like, makeup PR to every single agent or change this library and have all the agents update to this new. It just
 Much cleaner, you just maintain a service and to say connect to this thing and we will make sure it's up to date and it provides these tools or access to this kind of data. Yeah. Yeah. Like like apis or like, even just like separating
 Storage and compute? Yeah, it is a number. We think of is like you're suffering storage and compute. Um, you're separating the action, the intelligence and the context, I like that. Yes. And and I think that's
 That's how you should build agents. And I think we're just handling the context there, amongst other things, but the contacts players personally, when I'm thinking about,
 we're good, I think we're good and said, hey,
 Setback.
 And say, hey, I'm also not surprised you have multiple voice in your head because knowing you as well as I do.
