I'm barely recording. Yeah, yeah, we're recording. We're on. Oh, okay.
 We'll try it.
 So we did the agent Builder Summit. You gave a workshop before, that it was awesome. I had a blast. Hopefully you did, but I wouldn't expect you to tell me if you didn't right now in front of everyone. It was a, no, it was amazing. We build a voice agent from scratch with live kids, and then actually went up and builds out evals as we went along, which was really fun because it was actually how you build agents in production. Like, how do you actually take a voice agent, build a test edited though? The test appends like, you know, capabilities in like different things and improve the agent over the course of the workshop. Yeah, there was three guys that left. And I was like, how was it and they both look like Shell Shocked, because they were like, it was really good. I wasn't expecting that. But it was, it was good and they like almost couldn't talk because of how good it was and so that was a little bit of. Yes, you know, it's good. That's amazing. Yeah, it was cool. It was very cool to see and there was
 lot of voice, AI companies at the agent, Builders a big event too, which is cool because I tried to get a few of them there to make sure and showcase
 that like, this is happening. And a lot of really
 good products are being made with voice agents, totally. I think it was really excited. How many people were interested in voice AI yesterday? Because in my head I think over the past year it's certainly become, you know, last summer it was still very niche of a couple of companies were playing around with voice. AI people were saying, oh this is finally working. So this is really exciting space but it was small startups experimenting and now I think we see a large companies. Almost every company is thinking about how those boys say I fit into my agentic kind of vision or ICT plans. Yeah, and that's really exciting to see. Everyone from big companies to small startups. Thinking, how can I incorporate voice AI into my product? So, we saw a lot of that yesterday and I told you I go nuts when I have to deal with the old,
 Voice. Like what is it ivr? Yeah, absolutely crazy. Whenever I get on a call and it's that
 and so, I hope that transition that you're talking about of every company having this now,
 Happens sooner than later, what's funny? Because I think people when they say I don't want to be talking to a bot on the phone. I really saying I don't want to be talking to a bad thought on the phone but really if you could go I think similar things were said about websites. And why would I want go to a website versus? Just calling someone on the phone and making it happen or like I don't trust a website with my credit card or I don't trust things that are on on this website. Yeah. And then obviously there's a shift where Millennials would much rather go to a website and talk to anyone. And I think that with voice AI is actually creating this really natural interface where you can really quickly just like, imagine you can just call and change your appointment versus going to a website logging in for getting your password and finding a new time. Etc. And mentioning how much easier that is? When we created these websites and you would think, like, oh we've got it all on the website, why don't you use the website? You can change everything there, you can do it. But then the actual
 Active during it so painful. Sometimes for that very fact, like clicking around, you don't know the interface, you forget your password, you got to sign in all that so yeah, I 100% agree. Yeah, and I think that we forgot that actually talking is a very efficient way of doing things. Humans are have, you know, created speech over thousands of years and very efficiently communicate information. And so if there's a reason why when you're working on something you're like it's easier to just talk over the phone about this. And I think voice AI has this capability to create this. Very natural interface is in age of AI. When you're talking to either, like, a humanoid robot but even if you're just trying to get a task done, you can say, okay, here's what I'm thinking, I need to, I need to book a reservation or I need to like get this task done. It voice can be really natural and so I think what we're going to see is it almost every company is going to have a voice in their face of some kind for the interactions that make sense in the similar way that happened to what mobile
 After wet where you had not, everything is on mobile, but a lot of things are on mobile in different forms. And so, I think every company will have to think about what interface is makes sense via voice for us. And how can we make that really seamless? So that instead of having the way on the phone for 20 minutes to talk to a human, you actually have like a really seamless fast interface to get things done.
 I know that the customer support is a huge use case.
 What other ways are companies thinking about employees. Yeah, I think what's interesting about voice right now is 80% of the use cases, kind of fall in the same couple buckets, very customer. Support is overwhelmingly. The use case, this is because I think the infrastructure is already there. So it's an interesting case of like, you already had some level of automation with ivr. It's over the phone. So it's actually like a very defined Channel. Like you have one person talking to another person. So it's much easier to navigate. You have like a pretty, pretty defined side of things in place, and most companies for customers support will have like standard operating procedures. So, like,
 If you're a customer's per person, these are the things you have to say. So I think that's why it's taken off so much is because it's and also it's a very high large cost center for a lot of companies. But then, we're also seeing things like healthcare. So being able to like file claims book, appointments, all of these things that have to happen over the phone because it, these Legacy Industries had very little software permutation permeation because of there's just so many providers. There's so many, like, such high need for security and all of this but voice AI is cool because you had this Universal API where you can have a human talking to an automated system. So you don't need to have software Integrations. I think we see this with like Logistics too. So truck drivers there's so many different parts of the logistics system and a lot of those don't have you know a truck driver isn't going to integrate Software System.
 For if they're just doing, you know, maybe they have 50 trucks or maybe they have 50 drivers, there's small business and they're not entirely looking to adopt all of these new software systems and voice. AI again is really cool because it doesn't matter whether or not all of them, adopted one of them can adopt it automate something and then
 Still be talking to a human on the other side. Wow, the universal API is such a good metaphor. It's like you can use Tech now but you don't have to
 Have everyone else using Tech? Yeah, because everybody can talk mostly everybody. And so me sometimes better than others or better. No, I want to make a joke there but didn't didn't come up. But the the idea is like
 Having.
 Almost like this behind the scenes.
 Going on where you can leverage Tech and the folks that are using the tech. Don't even need to know. Yeah, in a way they'll know because it's Ai and so yeah, I'm talking to a bot but they don't need to know that. Like well you might have a really cool complex system in the background.
 And they can just sink into it with this Universal API. Exactly. And so, it doesn't. Yeah. And so, you can have like, doctors offices or
 Claims providers or truck drivers or HVAC system providers.
 All of a sudden be able to use this voice interface where especially if you're let's say you're driving around. In the car all day servicing, different HVAC systems, you're not entirely in front of a computer. You're not necessarily looking to acquire a bunch of complex software Integrations and setups your eyes. There were just so painful, exactly. But you can get in the car and say like, okay what's my next appointment or have? Someone answer the phone for you? While you're installing something. And now you haven't lost that next client. And I think there's also all there's all of these use cases that haven't been explored as much because they're, they're not even really, like automated systems there before. So, you know, all these people that are in cars all day, how can you help augment those? Like, if you are like, if you're a delivery person or if you are police officer or if you are like doing a, if you're like a Uber driver or like, how can we integrate this into waymo,
 Yeah, and self-driving cars. How could you control that in their face with with voice AI? Yeah. Yeah. I was thinking about how you might
 Want to help. I know I've heard of a company that is doing something around for doctors because they have to write a lot of crap after they see a patient. And a lot of their time is spent writing things down about the visit that they just had and so you can kind of extrapolate that out with a lot of different.
 Jobs, you have to have this component of, I need to write down what I just did.
 And can we have it be a voice agent that interviews you about what you just did and then writes it down for you so you can just answer questions.
 And you don't have to sit there and go into the UI and type it down or whatever, or even better like in the voice agent just be with you in whatever you're doing and then write it down and say hey here's what I got. Do you want to change anything totally? Yeah I think that's it. Definitely a big. It's like so much of our day today. Lives happens.
 Via voice, right? Like talking to your co-workers, you're talking to someone and then you want to recap it your like talking about the you're trying to communicate your plans. You're trying to communicate changes and so I think all of these places that you're talking to other people, there's opportunities for voice, AI to do to free up a lot that time to then do other more interesting things. Yeah. So now there's a big
 idea that we want to hit on which is how to make this reliable. Exactly. I think that's the biggest. That's the biggest thing that people are nervous about with voice. AI is like,
 That's great that I made this. But these are my customers or these are my business partners or people that are important to what I'm doing every day. I don't want the AI to all of a sudden then go brogue, which it has been known to do. Exactly. And I want to be promising refunds, I don't want to be giving discounts giving discount and saying the wrong thing and I think that's where something that's really hard is that you have to for every step in the conversation, it's an opportunity for failure, right?
 So, if you have, if you have a 10% failure, every point.
 It's pretty high. But let's say you have some percent of a failure at every point that failure could potentially compound throughout the stack. So the chance that any one turn fails, then all of us on becomes very high.
 But so you might say how will voice AI ever be reliable, in that case.
 But we've actually built out systems like this across all sorts of other parts of software. So for example, like the internet or you know a web application, every single stat, part of the stack is super unreliable. Servers are unreliable. Network connections are very unreliable, you know.
 All of your apis and all that jazz, but you create reliability. I have redundancy so you can add these fallbacks, you can, we've actually gotten to six nines of reliability for large-scale web applications and so I think the thing that I'm thinking about all day every day is how do you create that same amount of reliability for agents will also still making them the autonomous. It reminds me a little bit and I'm no expert and I wasn't around in Tech. I just heard stories of like databases being super unreliable back in the day and so that's why you had to create different kinds of databases that would maybe you Shard database and Cassandra comes up or maybe you have these new ways of thinking about databases so that you have a database that's specifically Never Gonna fail. And you have cockroach TV that comes up, you know, it's meant for that really like reliability. And so now when we're at the beginning of this, in the
 Voice.
 Spectrum of how it's going to take over.
 You you like are gonna probably start seeing some of that. I imagine like you're gonna start seeing, okay, this this voice agent is specifically. It's like the Cockroach DB of voice models. It's not going to be have any problems or maybe what you're talking about too. Is also each piece of the system needs to be like a cockroach and that it doesn't fail or if it does fail, we have ways.
 So that the end user doesn't realize it fails. Yeah.
 Exactly. And then like that that redundancy or fall back mechanisms. But yeah, I think that's something that people forget, is that building reliable web applications feel so obvious today like,
 The idea that you're application would go down. If you have, you know, 10,000 users go to your site. It's actually just by default. Like if you Deploy on AWS or versatile and you serverless, Etc, like it just works, it just works out of the box. Like everything is pretty secure out of the box. Like, there's a lot. You have to try pretty hard to make it terrible web application today.
 But I mean, that's, that's not to say that it's still easy but there's a lot of things that just become infinitely easier than they used to be and like, even like using RDS from AWS or like what any of these like Cloud databases there's like redundancy, they have like either leader replicas and then read replicas and like all these things that you don't even have to think about. You don't have to think about your server backs. You want to think about all these things but today with voice AI you still very much have to think about a lot of these things of like if my you know TTS provider and my 11 provider, and my STD provider, all have some variants in the reliability of how of their latency
 You have to be ready for all three of those things to not respond. For two seconds, that's going to be a six second latency. And if you don't respond for six seconds, I'm going to be like, hello anyone there, what's that? It's super unnatural. Six seconds is an attorney in a conversation. Yeah. Maybe for like normal.
 Oh yeah, I can't. If I don't, I don't respond for six seconds.
 oh,
 So you can, and that's not even, you know, API reliability. Like 99% tile of like one second delay is is notable and so I think when you're building voice, AI applications, you have to think about your latency budget, across everything. And not only your latency Budget on average, but your latency budget in any end percentile. Because if you have a 20 turn conversation, where if you have a 30 minute conversation, think about how many turns that is to the conversation and how many opportunities for failure? And if any one of those Fails, Like, if you, if the agent doesn't respond for six seconds, at any point, along that conversation, there's a chance to use, are just hangs up or like,
 Thinks that nothing is happening or Etc. And now, that whole conversation has failed, but the fail back or the ideas that
 You've seen work is it just like if something fails you have a go-to line that you say sorry something's not working. I'm working to make it happen better or I don't know what how do you deal with that? If you're noticing. All right, there's
 these failures that we kind of have figured out, but we know since there's such a high
 unpredictability we're going to have some at some point and so we need to like give the user some idea that we're still there, it might be taking six seconds but I have like a quick
 canned response that is well. So this is where you actually need to have. If like open AI doesn't respond or like this particular model provider like model instance, you can use same similar models of the same family and it hit those but you cannot have a fall back of like open. I doesn't respond then I'm going to use Gemini and so.
 That's you can kind of have these like quick fallbacks or like whichever one responds. First, I use that this fallback logic is actually pretty non-trivial. So that's why I say I orchestration, libraries like pipe cat or live kit are really useful. I think.
 Even more so than a junta application because a lot of this real-time streaming Voice orchestration is pretty non-trivial. So how do you actually create these fallbacks? You can actually configure them with these libraries to fall back like they handle all the fall back orchestration so that you don't have to implement that from scratch. Yeah, that's cool. And the other thing is like, isn't it?
 A big-time vulnerability.
 If?
 Any at any one point?
 You fail. And then it's almost like
 This can ruin everything. Maybe for the user. Let's say that the user is patient enough to stick around, but do you have
 Potential of like losing the context or is it not? Like I I think you were telling me that on the reliability aspect you have like all of this.
 It's like more high stakes but is it just because of the user that is not going to be patient? Or is it? Because they're if you lose something, then you potentially can lose the whole conversation and you gotta like start over from scratch.
 yeah, it's more than the user's impatience so
 I think.
 Like that's why we do a lot of these benchmarks around like model, not only model latency, but also model variation in latency. So the thing that's just as important as the as I said, like the 50th percentile is also the 99th percentile because if the 50th percentile is amazing but ninety and percentile is much higher than that, that person's going to be really impatient where you don't respond for 30 seconds. All of a sudden is a crazy amount of time that the person is just going to assume that the whole thing fails. Oh yeah. Yeah. If you don't respond for 30 seconds here somebody's hanging up. Somebody's hanging up. Yeah, exactly. It's awkward. Yeah. 30 seconds game over game over. Yeah. And so um I think that's similar so that's just one type of failure. But then there's all these other types of failures that I think these are the ones that get more airtime for Enterprise leaders. Where
 You are issuing refunds or you're saying you actually informational. If he exactly it's only your voice. Telling someone in the car for one dollar, you know that Tesla's better than Chevy. Yeah. All those yeah. All those problems come up and like you said, it's
 a very
 Valuable conversation that you're having so you could fuck it up big time. Yeah, totally. And and it's with customers too, which is a business that's, it's like a hot, is it? Yeah, exactly, it's high-stakes.
 And so I think that's where it's not only just performance but now you have this like quality aspect that I think is very different than SAS tools previously as well. Where before I was like the bunch of work every time but that's really a performance thing. Like what percentage of the time is the button working and usually pretty deterministic. But with voice AI. It's now super non-deterministic and what quality looks like is very different. Like there's obvious things where it goes, right and I think things where it goes wrong and there's this hole in between of wasn't quite perfect.
 Um, and so how do you do like instruction following evaluation or like did it do the right thing at the right time? Did it take the right action on your behalf, be a function calling and all of this Jazz, which opens up a whole can of worms of how do you make sure that not only your performance and you're saying the right thing? But you're saying the right thing at the right time. But you tested this, right? Yeah, with all the different providers. Yeah. So we've done the benchmarks across all of these different areas so TTS. Like how do you measuring latency measuring, whatever rate or like the accuracy of the model cost? And how do you balance these? I think there's a very common balanced across all of these models is like cost latency and quality. That's the vent diagram. Yeah, that's a Venn diagram and you can kind of like some models are just going to be like better everything but really there's no one size. Fits all like every model is going to have its trade offs and so
 How do you choose between for TTS, for stt for llms voice activity detection? They're like really interesting thing about voice. AI is that you have so many models all working together in order to orchestrate. This it's not just one llm, you have like all these models chained together in order to produce a really high quality output. And so that's why we've done a lot of the benchmarks is because we want to be able to show but as you're evaluating all these different models that are constantly every single week, they're new model is coming out and, you know, like opening. I just released a new real-time model. Should I use that one? And you know, like all of these TTS providers and stt or the constantly releasing new things.
 And so I think with voice here I'm more than ever having been real-time benchmarks and constantly monitoring the performance is super important for being able to understand what's happening. I guess that's the important part for the majority of people. It's like how much is it going to cost? How fast is it going to be and how? Well is it going to actually say what it needs to say but then on the how well does it actually say what it needs to say? There's a lot of New Orleans there out of imagine. Definitely. Yeah, so that's why like instruction following benchmarks are really interesting of like, is it following the right steps for five minutes conversation for attendant conversation for 30 minute conversation. And that's where I think with real-time models. It's still not obvious that you should use real-time over cascading, Muggles because the control ability isn't there? The instruction following is getting better and better but it's still if it's not following the instructions.
 Once it's happening. It's kind of Just Happening. There's all sorts of ways you can inject context which is interesting and I think we're still early days in different voice architectures with real time. What do you mean by inject context? So for example, like as the conversation is going, you can have a background agent saying like is this conversation going well and or like is this, are we missing any information? And so you can imagine that you have like a real-time model that's going back and forth and then you have another model that's saying whether information. Do I need. Like the person asks a question and then it goes and does it look up and then feedback that context into the next into the next turn. So I think regardless of your doing real-time or cascading model, cascading is where you have like text-to-speech. Oh, sorry, tags. Um, text to speech versus using a voice to voice model.
 Regardless, you still have this kind of as the conversation progresses, you want to
 You want to inject the right context for what that turn is trying to do. And so I think that's where actually voice AI is kind of been very early to contact engineering because there's just far too much context to feed into every single turn. That's exactly what I was saying. Like, how do you keep that context on and the most important things right? I want a 30-minute call. Yeah, exactly. Like you're exceeding the context window but also even beyond that it you start to very quickly have this needle in the haystack because there's all sorts of extra conversation or if you're doing a rag lookup you can't you can't those are like 10 to be costly lookups and so doing that in a really efficient way that you can get still fit within. That one second latency budget. When you're already using the late budget for lots of other things, I think has always been a very hard thing for, boys, Ai and so, there's like a lot of
 interesting things are happening around people having you know graphs so like as you go as you move through the graph it's like dynamically injecting contacts around like once you get to appointments scheduling you know the availability has already been pre-loaded or
 Like making sure that you inject the right step for the next turn. So, instead of saying at the beginning,
 Throughout this whole conversation. I want you to first ask the person for their name and their phone number and their availability and then send them an email, follow-up. Putting that all in one prompt might not perform as well as having a graph that's heuristics based and you say you're on you're at node one on this graph and then after the next turn, you're like, okay now you're at no two. Now you're at node 3 and this is the step that you should be doing right now. Yeah, I can see that for
 if you're trying to,
 Also close somebody on something close like a ticket or close a deal or whatever. And remember you're stuck at node 4 like please try to move to Note 5 it seems like you're not getting past node 4 for some reason. What's going on? Yeah, you can also add a little context there so I could see that. That seems like it could be very valuable. Now, what else was there on the
 Reliability side. I think the others like so many interesting voice, AI architectures that are coming out of
 I think in the earlier this year or even last year, most people are just trying to make things work end-to-end. You're just trying to say, does the voice AI application respond to you with something relevant in a reasonable amount of time. And now I think that is a that was kind of stuff. Like that's the first problem. Yeah, exactly the lowest bar. And I think now we're seeing it's been really cool to watch the industry of all over the last year, where that's like the first thing everyone cares about. Even in the workshop. Yesterday, as we were saying things up, we talked a lot about weights and see and the reason we talked about about latency is
 Nothing else matters. If you can't even respond, right? That's the step one. And that's a that's still not.
 It's still not trivial to get really low so you can see for boys AI. So, then step two is, can you finish the conversation? Can you have some directions to the conversation and get to the end? And then can you do more and more complex actions?
 What I think that's where we're seeing a lot of really interesting voice architectures of, you know, having this graph, the, this graph method or having background agents were having multiple agents responsible for different things. Having
 Like um One agent that's responsible for responding and other agent that's responsible for coming up with context or like all of these different things. I think people are coming up with is a really it's been cool to watch these architectures kind of evolved real time in front of us. Yeah, Zach yesterday was saying that they have a constellation of models or agents and a lot of times
 If when the conversation is happening or when the other when the user is talking and they think that they might need something, they'll just fire it off because in the unlikely case that they might need it. They would rather like have it and not need it and not have it and need it. Yeah exactly. It reminds me a lot of like Instagram in the early days was able to have insane latency not because they in latency was better in loading images and even analysis, but because they did predictive clothing. So they were even before you entered your password, they were pulling up all of your like, pulling up the first images and they are pulling up all sorts of like, content that you'd see it immediately as you walked in. Yeah. Or like preloading, you know, the ones to the left, the ones to the, right, the previous, and the next one.
 I think there's tons of opportunity there to do similar things, but the voice, AI, where it's, I think this conversation is going in this direction. So, I'm just going to preload
 This type of information or I'm going to start thinking about what to do next. Oh yeah. My name is think about the idea of hey the conversation seems to be moving to node 5. Let's get all of that stuff ready right now because it might take us a minute. I was thinking about like in the moment of I'm a slow talker a specially for a computer. I talk very slow, right? That didn't come out right. That made me sound like a computer but you as a robot it has a robot. I found that really hard. This entire conversation has just been generated video. Yeah have not actually been setting here it would be amazing once it gets those good but until then we're talking about this earlier how it's still a little uncanny valley on the video generation? Yeah. Yeah. Like a little awkward.
 Now you're trying to act like it. Yeah. So we are human. As far as we know. Yeah. Just we're here and then anyway, I was thinking like in the moment that I'm saying things, then it's grabbing it and it's like, oh well that the whole thing that Demetrius just said was two seconds long. They can get a lot of information and two seconds and then they'll have that ready in case they need it. And then be able to respond. If the whole
 Process took three seconds. It's a second response. At least what I feel, is a second response. Right? So I like that preloading idea. Yeah, I think there's also really interesting things around more as you. So following the right steps, when the steps are known like the standard operating procedure is customer service, these types of things. But what about when you want special exceptions, or like negotiating or these really autonomous behaviors? I think those are really interesting and how people can kind of start to handle. Like, this is like how an agent can negotiate with. These are the bounds in which I'm kind of comfortable. This is how I would be reasoning about the social interaction and how could you start to get agents to navigate those types of situations? Autonomously is really interesting.
 Yeah, I always worry about the negotiation. I always feel like I'm not gonna get a good deal here with or the agent is gonna just go to the lowest amount.
 yeah, well, I think it's
 Think there's a lot of interesting techniques from sales of or like, recruiting, right? Like large companies, when they're hiring, have hiring bands and kind of you can create like incentives and trade-offs. So I think, I'm not sure it's still very early days in that area. But like how do you give agents a set of tools where maybe they have a negotiation budget for a customer service? Or maybe they have a like this is the amount of refunds we can get out like based on all the conversations you've had today, how many of these which ones are the most deserved of those people that or like memory across conversations?
 That's not. I haven't seen that happening today but I think that's a really interesting area where you cross conversations. Like, oh yeah, Susie was just doing with this problem, too. Yeah, and we saw that this way. I think that's actually another area that is more people. Are exploring more, is kind of
 Reinforcing certain Pathways. So like I know I saw this problem this way previously in that worked. How can you in? How can you embed, that within your architecture, so that you can have memory of
 Maybe it's memory or like reinforcement, learning or like, there's lots of ways that you could implement this. But like, how could you have a? How can you remember, like, what things worked and then use that to make the agent better and better over time? Yeah, that better and better over time and knowing like, yeah I've seen it this way and I can do it this way. So that's how I'm going to do it. I remember, so again referencing the conversation yesterday with Zach, he was like
 It's still to this day like 80% of the Google searches have never been searched before. Yeah. And so the thing is that a lot of them are like similar
 But not the same. And so he said, that's when the agents will get a little bit messed up, because they think they know, and then they don't because they're like, oh yeah, this is the same as Susie and no, but actually it's a little different in this way and the voice agent will be like, no, it's Susan. No, no. I know how to do this. This is how to do it and so that's that can get super tricky. I imagine definitely I think memory in those cases is still really, really hard. Yeah. 80% of use cases, haven't been searched before is also resembles kind of really autonomous systems like self-driving where a lot of the scenarios that you've seen. It's actually down to, like you've never seen before this exact scenario, right? Like that exact person with that exact dog. With this exact street at this, with this lighting. And this, you know, whether conditions all this with that car. Yeah, is every single step is new and how can you create a system that's really autonomous. Well,
 So being incredibly reliable, I think there's a lot of parallels with voice AI of, you're going to have the same situations where you haven't heard this voice before, but this background noise, but these frequencies, but that's exactly asking for this thing. And yet you want to. So you want to be able to autonomously navigate that with incredibly High reliability. And I think that's just like a very exciting area is like, how can we create these really autonomous systems? Yeah, that's such a great point. It's such a like,
 Great parallel.
 And I think people kind of
 Again, the like sentiment towards voice, I is just so like reminds me so much of how people talk about self-driving, where they're both saying either. You know, tomorrow, we're gonna have self-driving cars. Like, no one will be driving a car like in one year from now. No one's gonna be driving a car. No one will have a license. So all just be like driving on autonomous cars. There wasn't even be like
 Regular cries a lot down the road and then there's this other extreme of people saying.
 Self-driving is never going to work. Look it failed right there. It will never work. Like will never have autonomous cars and the true answer is somewhere in the middle, it's going to take longer than we expect. It's going to look different than we expect. But the getting really autonomous systems that are reliable is totally in the realm of possibility for boys. And so I think we're both underestimating and overestimating voice at the same time where we throw a voice at something and say, like, it should, it sounds really realistic. So, she just work for everything today and then on the flip side, people are saying it fail. And there's one case, and we can never trust it. And I think there's like, there's somewhere in between, right? It's going to take a few years but and like iterations, but we get there.
 What is it? Oh my God.
