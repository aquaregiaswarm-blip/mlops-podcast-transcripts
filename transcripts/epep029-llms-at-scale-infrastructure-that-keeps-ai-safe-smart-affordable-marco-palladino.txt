The way we're using third-party software, or apis or Services is going to fundamentally change. I do believe. And it truly believe that the agents or even the prompts is the new browser. You know, we're not going to go on a browser, click around, you know, do things like we were doing in 1999 or
 2022. But we're going to be leveraging agents to do their job for us. And when there is an agent, on the other side, you really need to our front end. I mean, all you have all you need to have is an API or an MPC servers, that these agents can interact with and then provide the capabilities that
 I guess we both are kind of on vacation right now. I'm in Portugal, you're in Italy. Not bad places to be man. No. Well, I mean Italian, so I spent two or three months a year here, so when I work my family can enjoy a beautiful Italian summer. Yeah. Get the gelato and the pizza, says the July, so good. I was just in Lugano a few weeks ago which
 It isn't it? It isn't Italy. But it kind of is, you know, that's not too far. It's like I, I'm from Milano. Originally actually, my father is from here, but I grew up in Milano. So I used to go to an all the time. It's like an hour away. Nice. Well, I mean, you've been doing stuff in the
 Tech field for ages. I think what, people probably know you for these days is being the CTO of Kong, which is a, in my mind, a very successful company. You all have been doing some incredible things, maybe for the uninitiated. Can you give us the tldr of what Kong is?
 Kong is a company that provides a software for managing connectivity, API connectivity, microservices connectivity, Ingress controller connectivity. And of course, now that AI is becoming one of the major drivers of API connectivity in the world. All so AI infrastructure. So we usually run with the developers, we work with developers with organizations that have apis, or wants to build apis in the name for a to be able to secure it, manage it, and so on.
 So, how did you start to take notice of all of the agentic workloads? And almost, I imagine you probably
 Maybe had some sleepless nights when you're thinking about, okay? If agents are the future,
 What does that mean for apis? And as you said your vision is much bigger than just like, oh, we're not in API company, we're a connectivity. So, what's the next step there? Can you talk me through your
 Reasoning process.
 They have for sure, no, for a sleepless nights, that's the right way to put it, you know, AI is one of those things that happens once in a while. Once every half a decade, the ones a decade that fundamentally changes are your thinking about the world. Are you thinking about customers or users using your products in these new world? And, of course, for us, it's been a big driver of API traffic. So Kong being very much involved in the API space, when AI became popular, you know, all the models, the other lands charge, EPT. You know, and Tropic and so on. Well, it turns out that all of these llms were powered by apis. And so, as you were trying to build applications that harnessed the intelligence of all of these models, then you had to create more API traffic to be able to to consume it. And then these new argentic world where basically agents are now becoming
 These units of intelligence or execution that can do things for you, they use models to get that intelligence but in order for an agent to be capable, it also needs to integrate with an ecosystem of apis so that it can be capable to do something useful and smart because you know our agents if they don't have access to apis they could use the best model in the world but they are not going to be able much to do much with that model. If they cannot interact with the real world data and services and typically these things are offered via an API. Now, of course, now we're seeing in Industry that traditional wrestling apis in the identity world are now being a little bit, were placed with new protocols and CP being one of them. But the point being is that it's just a new API that we're now leveraging in using to build this new type of applications. So all of this was happening in front of our eyes and of course being very much involved in this space. How could we not see it?
 Happening in developing.
 yeah, I can imagine, it's something that you're probably
 keeping tabs on and then,
 all at once, it was like, well, we need to be very involved in this if things do shake down the way that
 People are expecting them to shake out and adjectives workloads, become more and more predominant. Then that's just like completely white space for you to go and capture some of the market, but also from the tech standpoint is probably really cool to think about, how does what we were doing with apis.
 how can that translate over to mcps and how can we
 Bring a bit more maturity to the mCP world. And I imagine you have been
 Doing stuff with like, working groups and the mCP community and that type of thing.
 Have you recognized like where folks are enjoying using mcps and where folks are not
 Well, I think MCPE, everybody enjoys enjoys having that MCPE server up and running and then being able to use it just because the ecosystem is now integrating with it. So you know the you know, mCP clients are now in the, our IDs, the R&D, you know the prompts that we typically use to ask questions to AI. So I think that once you have it, it's actually quite enjoyable to use. The problem is building it, there is lots of organizations out there.
 That are basically hiring developers to go build NCP, wrappers on top of every API, you're right. You know, once we saw these AI wave coming in,
 Given that we consider AI is being the latest driver for API. Adoption the more I add, the more Epi, you know, we also build infrastructure products that help with MCPE by the way. So it's not just an AI Gateway for and Lambs that we provide, but also an AI Gateway for mCP. And we also have introduced the ability to automatically how to generate mCP servers from any restful API that you may already have. So the goal truly is to remove the unpleasant part of mCP which is building it scaling, it deploying it, putting it behind a load balancer, you know, we can get rid of all of that. As long as you have an open API spec, just take that Speck and we generate an mCP server on the fly. But then once you have these ecosystem of mCP servers, it becomes quite nice because then you can now build a catalog of mCP servers that your agents are going to be able to use. Now, the problem with MCPE is security, I mean I think there is still lots of open questions on how we are going to be dealing.
 With security, especially when we're trying to impersonate the end user when consuming an MCPE server, I think that we as an industry, you know, all together have to come up with a solution for that.
 But I'm sure that you know, the specification is moving very fast, it's evolving very fast, they just added Security based on or out you know, at the front end of the mCP server. So we will have also to figure out how to implement the authorization process across all the mCP servers that you can consume. But, you know, once we figure that out, I think it will become even more powerful and even more widespread because then end users are going to be able to use an mCP server. That can impersonate, let's say they're Gmail account, they're, you know, Google Docs account, they're, you know, Uber API account and so on, and then start doing more interesting things with it. Exactly. As soon as my agent can understand that I bought tickets to the dead in company show, and I need an Uber there and definitely back then, I will be happy.
 that I don't need to organize any of that it gets done or even I like to reference like the date night example where
 I have an agent that understands I bought tickets to whatever.
 Like the orchestra and there's two tickets and I'm going with my wife and so it can organize a dinner. Maybe get reservations. All of these things that
 Would be very nice to offload to an agent right now. It feels like what you were saying is.
 It's really cool for engineers to stand up these mCP servers and folks like the idea of them.
 But actually putting them to use and getting.
 A lot of mileage out of them.
 In my experience, I haven't seen as much but maybe you've been in a different field because you're so far into it.
 Are there. Cool, use cases, that you've seen with mCP servers that are in production. They're being used by and they're being consumed by a large amount of folks, I think, I think it's starting now. I mean, organizations, you know, these moving so fast, it's moving fast faster than the organizational are able to adapt, but but there are very smart Progressive teams.
 That are AI native inside of the, you know, organizational that are dealing with our health insurance is banking, you know the type of customers that we work with, you know, did you digital and technology companies as well that are starting to harness and use, mCP, more and more. Now the thing is,
 You know, there's still not much infrastructure available for running MCPE at scale. So what many of these organizations have been doing? It's also kind of Reinventing the wheel and building NCP servers but then also building the NCP analytics, the NCP security, DMC, catalogs, and so on and so forth, to be able to make mCP usable and governable within the organization. So, part of my job as a CTO, is to observe the pattern of people duplicating their work and try to find a way to bring all of that duplication inside of our products. So that our customers can focus on building, the best agents, the world has ever seen. Instead of having to build all of these cross-cutting requirements that are needed at the infrastructure layer to be able to then run and scale, right? So that's, that's part of, you know what? I'm trying to notice.
 Yeah. And that's such a good point like where the antipatterns so that you can help and then ideally throw that in the product and then people don't have to think about it, because it's in, it's been abstracted away for them.
 Now, for sure. But you mentioned something that's very interesting, you know, in your example of going to concerts buying tickets or during food
 something that
 A clear that may happen. There's a very high chance that it's going to happen in the future.
 Is that the way we're using third-party software, or apis or Services is going to fundamentally change? I do believe. And it truly believe that agents or even the prompts is the new browser, you know, we're not going to go on a browser, click around, you know, do things like we were doing in 1999 or
 2022. But we're going to be leveraging agents to do their job for us. And when there is an agent on the other side, you really need to have front end. I mean, all you have all you need to have is an API or an MPC servers, that these agents can interact with and then provide the capabilities that that you want. And so you know, in a world that's dominated by AI where agents are becoming more and more on extension of ourselves to be able to do some of the things that today we do ourselves. But the agents will take over and do for us. I think that that you know concept of
 Front end props is also going to be transformed and revolutionized. I mean is the next Airbnb? Going to be a front end when people can click you know, like today. Or is it going to be a list of curated mCP servers that are going to be showing you previous of rooms, previous of prices and all of that in a prompt via a prompt. Right? So I think, I think that we're just at the beginning of a massive Revolution on how we as humans are using technology in our daily lives.
 yeah, the
 Interface with the model. Being like the new browser is something that I heard my buddy Simba talking about. Last time I was in San Francisco and
 I also remember right? When chat gbt was getting popular back in 2022.
 My other buddy Willem was saying, you know, man. It's just gonna be agents to agents. There's not going to be like me, scheduling anything with you. We're just going to let our agents do that and you've kind of seen that happen a little bit because that's a very, I guess you could say, like that's a very understandable example but I wonder
 if back in the day, when the internet was getting popular,
 if there was so much talk about what is possible when we connect, all of these different computers and when we have this open communication with people all around the world instantaneously, and I remember that
 like 90% of what we thought it was going to be, was completely wrong.
 However, I wasn't actually like deep into the tech world when that was happening. So, I don't know too. Well, if there were folks that were like, yeah, they were the nostradamus' and they could predict what was going to happen with the internet, but
 all that is to say, like,
 we're understanding the agent world through our current context of the way that we interact with the computer and
 I'm constantly asking myself like how can I think bigger?
 To understand what is possible. If we do have the agents, 24/7 going on
 But these change, if you think about it has already happened in the past. What did we have before the internet? We had yellow pages. So what was the main way for a customer to get in touch with a business? It was the fall, you would take your Yellow Pages, find the business and call pick up your phone. And that's and that's how the businesses will try to transact. Then the internet came the browser came. And now all of those businesses that used to have, you know, these, you know, increase in the Yellow Pages, they all started to create websites. Why? Because now websites becomes the main way that people start interacting with those business, the businesses will always change in adapt to provide the right mean of communication so they can still communicate with their customers capture cash. Customers are, you know, in earn their business and therefore if customers stopped using the browser more and more, and they start using agents more and more to drive their business likewise in the past. The Yellow Pages were replaced by the browser, the browser will be replaced by The Prompt. I mean, it has happened before and it will in
 Of the happen again, if customers start interacting with these businesses in a different way, right? And the businesses that do not adapt, those are the ones that will be replaced by the ones that do. Imagine being a business when the internet becomes popular that doesn't, you know, refuses to create a website and still insists on just being on the Yellow Pages, you know that business? That's it, you know, there's not any future whatsoever for that business, you know. And they're gonna be replaced by the ones that do cater to these new type of outages. Actually you bring up a great point which is almost that Bezos ISM of let's focus on what doesn't change as opposed to what is potentially going to change and now it's going to change and you're you nailed it on the head when you're like,
 businesses are still going to need customers, they're still going to need to interact and talk with customers in some way, shape or form and get the customers to know about what they do and how they do it. And maybe there's promotions, there's all that stuff happening.
 The shape of how that looks, whether it is in the Yellow Pages or it's through the browser. Now, it's through agents is the thing that will be changing, not necessarily like the higher level, I'm a business. I need to make money the way I make money is through clients. So let me get clients.
 They'll just go wherever their customers are. And and if the customer becomes the agent because, you know, when once we have an army of Agents, taking care of our Lives, taking care of our bookings, taking care of our reservations taking care of everything. Then effectively the agent, almost becomes the customer to all of these different services. And so the businesses that will try in an agent, agentic world are the ones that can cater better to these new type of customers, the agents themselves.
 That actually brings up a thought of.
 We have SEO right now.
 For, when we're searching for companies and we need something.
 but there's not like the mCP, SEO type of thing where you have the model recommendations where if you're dealing with the
 foundational model.
 If you are recommended in the cloud output or the chat should be output, that's great.
 But I also wonder.
 If the agents are going to have preferences, maybe it's that certain mcp's or better written or the servers are nicer. So you almost get like this SEO from that. I know this is completely
 Tin Hat type shyt but it's fun to think about like wow could we have specific SEO at the mCP level as opposed to the model level. I don't know, maybe it's all dealing with the model because the model is what is the brain at the end of the day.
 You know, I had said a very provocative thought, I think that, you know, Marketplace dominated by humans, you know our Modern Advertising, you know, works, you know, the louder, the brighter and you know, and that's how you win, you're the business, who knows? Perhaps the marketing of, you know, magentic world. It's not being louder in the, you know, the brightest or the biggest, you know, billboard in the world anymore. It is having the lowest latency. So you want to earn more agentic business, then you have to provide the lowest latency because it means that the agents are going to be completing their job in a quicker time frame.
 Yeah.
 Dude, that's, that's fun to think about. And that just comes back to like
 Why? It's it's so interesting this spot that you sit at because I imagine that's something that you're thinking about like oh how can we make these whether it's mCP servers or it's just apis the best that they can be so that a people don't have to have headaches with them but B the interactions with humans or agents
 Can be the most optimized.
 100%, you see I think the technology is most likely will change. I mean the underlying technologies that are going to be powering the agentic world
 Perhaps the will change, perhaps LMS, as we know them today, and they will evolve into something else, you know, mcps, as we know it today will evolving, but the idea that there's going to be something that can make decisions for us. I think that, that idea, you know, once it's out of the of the ball, you know, the genie is out of the bottle then, you know, it's not gonna go back in and I think that that will happen. Now, the question becomes, what are going to be the technologies that are going to be enabling in this world? And you know, you work with the community, you work with ecosystems with the foundations to make sure that, you know, you understand what what that is going to look like, but there is no doubt that the world we knew from the early 2000s until, you know, until now it's going to be the same world. It's gonna dominate in the next 10 to 15 years. So, this is happening. It's happening whether we like it or not, and my job is a CTO, is to ensure that if someone is out there building infrastructure for these new world, while it better become instead of somebody else. So that, you know, we can, we can capture these early adopters, we can support them.
 Early on with their infrastructure work and we're doing it today. By the way, you know, our AI Gateway is rapidly growing you know, from a business standpoint because every organization in America right now in the world, not just in the US, truly is now diving in and jumping into these argentine's opportunity because they do understand that, if they don't do that, somebody else will and can still the opportunity for from them. You see companies,
 Are made or disrupted during these massive periods of transition when the mobile comes in massive, the internet. First and foremost, then mobile comes in. You know, if you are not on mobile, you're dead, you know, you have to have a mobile strategy with a mobile application, then it's the cloud massive transformation and then now it is AI.
 Companies new companies emerged and, you know, older companies fail when they see these new waves of transformation coming at them, but they avoid to disrupt themselves to be able to capture these opportunities and that creates a window of opportunity for for somebody else to jump in and steal the opportunity from them. We've seen that, you know, in the past with Blockbuster and Netflix, or your typical case, study of organizations that are not adapting or, you know, Kodak when we transition from analog cameras to digital cameras. And today, we're transitioning from a pre AI world into an AI world and likewise every other transformation before companies that see, these opportunity are the ones that are going to win. And so we're seeing lots of organizations right now that understand the threat and strategic risk, but also the opportunity of investing early on in AI because this is what we're the world is going. And they are also partnering with Cog and with us and others to provide these
 Early beginnings of an agentic world. First inside of their organization to transform their business processes, but some of them are also offering these
 As new products that the customers can use to increase their retention and to increase their engagement to cross-sell more products. So, we're starting to see the beginning of AI being used internally, but also externally, and I think it's very exciting because right now, it is a very creative space. Everybody's trying everything and see what works and see what doesn't. And it's just very exciting to see.
 Actually along those lines. What are some of the coolest use cases or most creative? Most awe-inspiring use, cases, that you've seen.
 Well, so, first and foremost, the marketing departments around the world are being revolutionized. I mean, in the ability to, for example, articulate the value of products, being able to enable our Salesforce, you know, all of that is being automated with AI. I've seen all so ai-powered sales teams. Now, by the way, that's another angle. You know, today, we're selling to humans, maybe in the future, we'll be selling to agents. How do you even communicate and advertise to them? You know, going back to the conversation. We had earlier, we're gonna have sales teams, are we going to have agents selling to other agents? What does that going to look like? So, I'm seeing some of that. I'm seeing. Lots of innovation in the video. AI space. The ability to take an image of me, holding a cup of coffee and then leveraging AI to creatively, replace that cup of coffee with a bird. For example, you see like a bird, just flying on my hand, instead of being the original picture that I had therefore the ability to create small movies just by thinking about what I would like to see and what I would like, you know, AI.
 Come up with. So I think there's going to be massive disruptions in how we generate content. We've seen that already, massive disruptions in Creative spaces like Video Hollywood. You know, why should we wait for Christmas for to watch our favorite movie? When we can invent a new movie every day and AI is going to do that for us as well. There's going to be lots of disruptions in in the legal field and you know there it's all over. It is permeating every area of society that is what makes it also quite exciting because we're just at the beginning of a massive transformation in the world. And this is when
 Good companies emerge. The ones that can take advantage of these opportunity. They emerged to be able to cater to this new world. So we're going to be seeing lots of transformation and whenever there is transformation, there is, it's excitement. At least, from my part because I like to see what everybody is doing and where everybody is ending up with you know financial services companies are now. Creating AI, powered Wealth, Advisors wealth advisors that used to be only given to ultra high. Net worth individuals. Well the now creating AI powered advisors for portfolio analysis, Investments strategies. And so on that, everybody can use, these is creating a good positive effects in their business because now everybody has more engagement. Everybody invest more. Everybody is basically leveraging their services in a much better way. So AI is being used already in some of these use cases and this is just we're just scratching the surface.
 so now getting a little bit into the weeds of the AI Gateway that you were talking about,
 Are you seeing that?
 Folks are just hitting rate limits left and right. Is it like what was the impotence behind? Why you need a Gateway and the value? It brings is it just switching.
 certain tasks to local models, or
 Very safe models and then other tasks can go to open AI or Claude that type of thing like how, what's the shape of these gateways? I know it's hard to say.
 a general blanket statement, but maybe you've seen some patterns that you can call out,
 Well, the AI Gateway provides infrastructure for AI agents. That means it provides infrastructure to consume the lands and infrastructure to consume. Didn't NCP servers and apis because we need both of these things to create capable agents.
 So what it provides is a whole layer of governance to be able to expose what the apis, what models we want. Our developer teams to be able to use when they're building agents and being able to govern that. So tiers of access to the models tiers of access to the mCP servers, the ability to auto-generate mCP servers from every API, the ability to implement the security authentication authorization in all of that. Then there is a whole layer of observability that's being extracted out of the box. You know whether we have one agent or a million agents running across multiple teams, we need to have an understanding of what is that? These agents are doing. What models are using, how many tokens what you know, what's their latency, what apis they're using. So all of these observability we're talking about hundreds of metrics, can be easily collected using the AI Gateway technology without the AI Gateway. We would have to build security all the time, inside every agent, would have to extract observability all the time. Instead of every agent, these basically removes all these.
 Cross-cutting requirements away from the developer teams that can focus now on doing what they should be doing and that is building the best agents in the world as ever seen. So the time to Market gets quicker while the same time we have control and governance on top of that but then close to helps with the choosing different models. So for example,
 Kong as a were created a universal API where you can build your agent once and then the flip of a switch you can transition to different models, even across different vendors. So you can build once and then go from openai to Azure from Azure to bedrock from Bedrock to databricks without having to rewrite the agent code. So it's a universal interface that allows you to choose the best model for the job to load balance and Route across the best model for the job. For example, we may want to Route very simple prompts to cheaper models. And we want to Route more complex prompts to more expensive reasoning models, and we can then more efficiently, manage our spend and we can more efficiently manage the latency of those responses. Things like guardrails things like semantic acceleration of our requests think over building a semantic. CDN for all of the AI response is the ability to implement rack pipelines in a much. Better way. The ability to sanitize
 pii information without having to us developers to do it in every time they build an agent. So we can apply blanket rules to sanitize. All pii Social Security numbers, name, addresses, you know, all the pii data in such a way. The organization has a higher Comfort level that these data.
 It is not going to be leaked, you know models are notoriously a very good, you know, there are very bad at keeping secrets or in the and they they like to disclose all of these information or if asked the right way and so being able to provide a mechanism, to enforce a security, I mean, we need all of these things to go in production with AI, it's unimaginable for an organization to build agents that others are using or even internally without having a certain degree of comfort on how they're being governed used observed managed secure. I mean, it's just the 1.1 a of building agents.
 Yeah, it's very much table stakes and that's why I think a lot of folks are still in the phase of
 We're testing, we're doing the pocs. We're trying to get it to work, but until you get all of that.
 Enterprises type of stuff down and clear and at least have a story and have checked all the boxes. It's very hard to just be like what's yellow this in the production and see what happens.
 know, I mean it's like I said it's table stakes and, you know, developers also
 these may not necessarily be their area of expertise so you know we want we want to enable as many developers as possible in the organization to be able to innovate and with AI and build agents and so on
 but we cannot do that if
 whenever they start, we're asking them to do 100 million things that goes beyond creating the actual agent. So yeah, I truly believe that this creates and by the way, platform teams exist for a reason and that is they existed to identify these things that everybody needs to do. Take them away and centralize them in a core platform in a core service that can be given to different lines of businesses different developers and so on. So on one on one end, we work with the platform teams to provide these infrastructure. They they can control, but then on the other end, we're also accelerating the developer teams that are building agents because now they don't have to do all these other stuff, so it's much easier for them to kick, you know, to to, you know, hit the road with their own agents and get started.
 Now.
 How are you going about making the decision on where and what to invest in because, especially in the AI space? There's a lot of noise out there and a lot of different product directions. I imagine you could take maybe with mCP, it was fairly obvious. So you thought, okay, we're going down that road because it just has so many similarities and parallels to the API world. But with other areas like,
 I'm guessing the AI Gateway wasn't your first foray into creating AI products. And so, maybe you have some products that died on the cutting board or maybe you try to put them out and you just didn't see the adoption. Like you were saying on that Playbook, once you see a certain amount of ARR or a certain type of adoption, then you can graduate it to the rest of the customer base. Were there ones that you tried that did not get that type of adoption.
 Um, you know, I gotta say something when when I decide to start something, I usually pretty high conviction. You know, because why, why do something, if you're not, highly convinced that it's the right thing to do them.
 And so, you know, from the office of the CTO, we, you know, at Kong, we created the first English controller, you know, to Target, kubernetes workloads, kubernetes became, you know, ubiquitous kind of popular. Yeah, so that worked when service mesh became a industry Trend. You know, we came up with a very compelling, very powerful service. Mesh product that went very well, you know, I think the service mesh market right now
 You know, AI stole the tender. Let's put it from, you know, service mesh. And I would, I would, you know, I'm seeing. But, you know, it was a very successful product that grew and was transferred to the ring, the organization then insomnia was another product today that the office of the CTO to cover and we were able to 10x our Revenue in in less than 18 months. So we also were successful with that, you know, with the AI. Now we did, they are the AI Gateway. That also has been very successful, so I'm not saying that I'm not done mistakes, but the thing is, if you start with something and you keep iterating with customer feedback and you keep micro pivoting, you never really fail because you are basically simply realigning your product to where the market is going, and where the customers are going. So, I would say that there hasn't been a project right now that I've canceled simply because of the high conviction, I have when I start something. So, it's more along the lines of
 The product you first.
 created in the beginning was a vastly different product than what it is today because of all those micro pivots
 actually, yes. You know what? I'll give a product that we shut down and that was the original product. You're absolutely right. Kong is the result of a pivot. Our first idea was an API Marketplace because, you know, back in 2010 when we started this business, we were thinking if the world is going to be dominated by apis, which ended up being true, then the world would need an Amazon of apis, we're sellers and buyers can transact apis. And so we wanted to build out the first Amazon for apis or Marketplace of apis. Well, in 2010 people were asking as what is an API you know, nobody had any clue but then obviously, eventually apis became real
 So, that was the good bet that we made.
 The bad bad that we made was that the marketplace was still early on and it didn't really, it really didn't really work. So when we decided to build Kong Kong actually, was the technology that the marketplace was using internally to process all of these API requests. And so, we took the most valuable thing that we had built for ourselves our technology and we extracted it and then offered it Standalone and that's how Kong came to life. And then the marketplace was shut down and sold to another company. So, we did, we did shut down Mass shape. I don't consider mashup to be necessarily one of those. Oh, you build something, you shut it down because in reality, thanks to the marketplace. Mashup was called, thanks to the marketplace. We were able to then build Kong and sort of the spirit of mashup continues to live to these day because of Kong which which was the biggest private Market fit we found back in those days. No, talk me through how you get the conviction.
 Like, what is?
 Something that will.
 Get you enough conviction. To say, we need to go and build around this and then you figure out the product. You do those, like I really like that, the course Corrections, the mini course, Corrections. So that you're always aligning to what the customers asking for, but
 What is it before that that you you need to see to be like, yeah, we're going for this.
 you know, I think that at this point
 I'm not looking at being necessarily the first ever to do something.
 I'm actually look for early indicators of somebody else doing well into an emerging category. And then, you know, try to find out ways on how we can potentially even go even further and even more advanced in that category and, you know, I think that being first ever,
 Um, I mean a way Kong API, Gateway was the first ever open Gateway in the world? You know, I know how hard it is to be first in absolute terms and it's very unlikely for every founder or organization to be the first ever in a new field is just very unlikely. It took us six years to be first with Kong Gateway and six years of trying working 24/7 sleeping in the office sleeping on a couch. I know how hard it is. So now that Kong as an organization grew a little bit more, you know, we have the luxury preps to wait a little bit longer and by that, I don't mean, you know, it's still waiting six months, right? So it's not like we're waiting for five years waiting for six months. Just to see that something that's beginning to get tracking in Industry works well. And at that point, we decided to go in with very high conviction. What we do at the end of the day and ends up being always a good choice, a good product for the users for the customers because not of the things that we did other.
 Would be successful if we did not reinvent and we imagine how those things would work in the first place. So, at the end of the day,
 Everybody benefits from competition. We benefit the customers benefit and and the industry benefits as a whole. But that's that's one way that you can reduce that risk because the risk, it's very high very early on and then it kind of drops, it's like depreciation. If you looked at the risk of starting a new business and you looked at depreciation chart of a card, they brought of a car, it would probably look the same. You know, the first, the first, the first, you know, 5% of the of the life of a car that appreciation Just Hits all at once.
 And and likewise with risk, when doing something new, the biggest risk is the beginning. If you wait, only, you know, four or five, six months, you're already materially reducing that risk. And you can go in with still a very high risk level, but not as higher as it would have been if you did from scratch.
 So you have the office of the CTO, is that a group of is that like a small team that you've curated that are able to do this almost like R&D with you and what is the composition of that team? Look? Like, is it a lot of Visionaries or is it just Builders executors a little bit of both? It's Builders people that have passion in building. Whenever I need to build something new, I actually rebuild my team from scratch all the time. So I really, I really like hiring and I really like building as well and so when we build something and then it works, we transfer the whole Squad, the whole team to the main R&D organization.
 Inside in such a way that they don't disrupt the products themselves because imagine, you know, having a group of people building products. Then you transfer the product. You still want to be people that have built that product to still continue working on it. Yeah, we transfer. That whole thing, that leaves me with a big problem that every time I want to start something from scratch, I need to basically go and rebuild a team and that's great, because sometimes I go build things in different directions and the team have hired to build an infrastructure product, may not be the same team that I'm going to be hiring if I'm building a developer and user product and so I go ahead, leverage my network higher very quickly and go and build in hit the road with, you know, a new idea, a new product, a new team and try to ship usually within six months. So we work in a very Relentless way, lots of energy and I think that's what happens when you really believe in to something and you have high conviction into something that you just don't waste time. We just go keep going and keep running since they want.
 And in turns out that, you know, the teams, love it too. By the way, because they get to work on basically a startup within the startup.
 So they get to experience that, you know, they have lots of ownership, lots of decisions that they can make, and I want them to make because absolutely, you know, the first time people building a product should be absolute owners of the product. So we listen to all ideas, we listen to all decisions, we go ahead, we build, I bring them in front of customers. I bring them in front of the users and then there is nothing better than looking back and be like, oh, you know, wow, these things look like a crazy idea. 12 months ago, 18 months ago and now we have 200 evaluation ongoing when perhaps, you know, 20 or 30 customers that are currently using the product in production to transform how they're doing things, they're in their own organizations. So I think it's very rewarding but it's for sure very high intensity and to be fair I don't know any other way to build new products other than having a high energy high intensity and and also lots of purpose.
 Yeah, I'm almost like jealous of folks in your position that have a strong customer base that you can go, and you can talk to it. And when telling time,
 because,
 I know how hard it is for Founders to try and find that product Market fit and being able to talk to existing customers, feels like you get to almost short-circuit that Loop and get
 Into those conversations faster. Easier and focus are already trusting you with one product, so they're probably going to be very forthcoming when you're asking them different ideas.
 People in companies have a reputation. So our ability to innovate and deliver in the past, certainly is a lower risk in the eyes of an early adopter for a new product. So I mean, for sure, I think I think it does help.
 But, you know, I it does help to get to the first input perhaps, but then to continue working with the user working with a customer continue building that product, you know, that's back on the shoulders of the team, you know. So yeah, I I think it does help.
 probably, it does not help as much as you think it would because at the end of the day, when you're building something new,
 The truth lies in how good your executing, and whether they discuss customer was already a customer of yours or not. If the product is not good, then the product is not good. So it doesn't matter how that first input happens. Yeah, it's not like they're gonna put up with a shity product if they're already using one of your products turn.
 Look, if you're going, if you're going to a restaurant, you really like, you know, you may try the new appetizer but if the new appetizer is not good. Well you'll tell them it's not good. Yeah. Yeah. And you're definitely not gonna order it again. That's you're not gonna order it again and do you normally do it with like, design Partners, like a startup would where you choose three or four design Partners. You work very closely with them because I imagine a team of 10, you don't have resources to go and talk with half of the Kong user base.
 Know, we we usually try to find because you know also customers exist on a different spectrum of willingness to innovate and adopt. There are some teams that are very Progressive in some organizations and sometimes you find these teams in the organizations you would expect it. The least you know like very old school organizations but very strong team.
 Fine. Let's work together. They want to transform their business, they think that to transform their business. They need our new technology.
 Well, the incentives are aligned. My job is to make sure that I am an extension to their team and building deliver the best technology product they can use in their job, is to adopt it so that they can, you know, their business can benefit from leveraging, these new technology and their happy with their growth. I think you, you want to have a few design partner's, but I think you also want to be opinionated.
 A quite a lot. I would say in in how you are,
 Influencing Your Design partners because, you know, with a design partner, you may also receive all sorts of requests that make no sense and my job is a CTO. It is to it is basically a pattern recognition job. I talked to many customers. I try to identify what each one of them wants and what it's very unique for each customer and what everybody wants a ship in the product and what's very unique for each. One of them I provide an SDK or an extension point where they can go in, customize it and it makes them happy and I don't go in and go deep into rabbit holes that I know they're not going to create any opportunity for. I mean, you know, I know it's it's cliche but the ability to say no is a real thing. You need to say no sometimes. Oh yeah, you can step in a lot of shit if you just start trying to be everything for everyone,
 Anyway, and I think that's the most reasonable design partners are also going to be the ones telling you, hey, you know what, we think that what we want is quite reasonable and we would like you to implement a solution for this. That's also reasonable for other customers because we don't want these one-offs that perhaps in a couple of years are not going to be maintained anymore. So the good, the design partners are the ones that understand that they're building a long-term partnership with you or with us. And, and they want us to build a roadmap. That's a good roadmap. It is not Frankenstein of weird, not there. Yeah, not their world map because they understand that. If they are the only market for your product, then their product is not going to exist for much longer anyways.
 Yeah, they're very big client, I can imagine. But even then, you can't have a sustainable product for just one client know. And the good is that design Partners also understand that. So, they don't want these, you know, big one offs because they know that we're, we're not gonna, you know, it doesn't make any sense for us to go. So, you put in to
 Production, AI Gateway. And now is there?
 Certain things that you're starting to see that are starting to Peak your interest on, what's next? Or is it like you're gonna invest the next one or two years in the AI Gateway.
 How does it work? Now, is there like new R&D that you're already thinking about?
 all the time, all the time, the momentum is very high and it never stops if you
 If you looked on my, you know, I have two displays in front of me, but if you open up the jira board for our way I Gateway, it doesn't fit. So then my job at this point is that to ensure that we prioritize properly? You know, it's basically my job at this point is the job of a PM, right? So it is, it is, as a CTO, I see the opportunity. But then, as a PM, you know, the day-to-day building of a product, it's not nothing exotic to be fair, you know, it's stand-ups planning, you know, talking to the team talking to customers. So, at this point, my job is the job of a PM
 And I prioritize my you know, there's lots of things that we want to build. We started with managing a lamps. We now have realized that the MCPE is a big requirement and so we rolled out one of the most advanced mCP Gateway capabilities inside of our AI Gateway. Even the ability, like I said to generate mCP servers with from scratch without any line of code from any restful API and then being able to visualize these NCP servers in a catalog that allows developers that are building agents to explore all the potential Integrations that they can use when building you know all of these is very Innovative. It does not exist out there. And so
 The roadmap is moving quite fast where partnering with customers quite fast, just yesterday, we closed nine more Enterprise customers in one day, you know, basically, for AI Gateway. We're talking about organizations that taught up Fortune 500. So the amount of work is certainly not lacking and there is no no opportunity for us to slow down because if you slow down now, then we lose the momentum and we lose the opportunity. And to be fair, when building a new product, the most exciting part is to be in this position. It is to build something that finally, people want to use you. Get lots of inbound, lots of requests. And so if you have waited, you know, for many months for this to happen, for sure you're not slowing down now that you have it. So if anything you grow bigger, you grow faster. You hire more people and you try to provide the best value that's possible to provide to our customers to, you know, for them to continue being
 Errors for them to expand, of course, and for us to be able to then capture and acquire new customers. You know, our success is very tight and linked with the success of our customers. Because if our infrastructure doesn't enable them to do the things that they want to do well then our infrastructure is wrong. Our product is wrong and they're going to turn and and we're going to lose them as customers. And so we're very aligned with all the initiatives that they have. And I think that something that's very interesting is being technology vendor like COG
 Is that you also get to see?
 How different Industries are.
 A revolutionizing how we interact with them. You know, when you one day I speak with Healthcare organization, you know, there are revolutionizing how their patients, you know, get access to all of their test results and so on, you know, that's something that millions of people use every day. Then the next phone call, it is with a financial services organization. You know, we have billions trillions of dollars under management or in their in their bank. And they're trying to provide new ways for customers to get the sense of their Financial Health, for example, and then you speak with another customer, you know, transportation technology travel retail and you are seeing the change that AI is doing not only from the eyes of founder and CTO of Kong but also from the eyes of a top Fortune, 500 Healthcare organization Financial Services, Retail transportation. So you're seeing the world changing in front of your eyes at 360 Degrees. There's nothing that's more exciting than that because it gives you so many data points.
 Awesome, dude. So Kong is higher. Is what you
